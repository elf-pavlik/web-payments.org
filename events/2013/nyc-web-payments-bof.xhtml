Scenario #1: Jane wants to accept Bitcoins as advance payment
in February for the vegetables that she will grow on her farm as part
of a seasonal community-supported agriculture program. She is
concerned that the value of a Bitcoin will change so drastically that
by the time she is delivering vegetables, the portion of her advance
funding for harvest operations will have halved in value and she will
be unable to afford to run her farm during delivery. A new economic
tool is needed to ensure the price stability of a Bitcoin so that she
can accept Bitcoins for long-term contracts without fear of their
devaluation over time.

Scenario #2: If a company in Canada signed a six-month contract in March 2013 
with a software developer in Brazil in which payment was denominated
in either Brazilian Reals or Canadian Dollars, then by the end of the
contract in August the buyer and seller would have experienced more
than a 10% difference in purchasing power compared with the
beginning of the contract. Currency hedging techniques typically
add complexity and involve service fees, so they may or may not be
advisable.

How do we create an open payment standard for the Web that permits the
stable interpretation of prices for tangible goods and services in
various currencies? Can the Web Payments Community Group come up with
ways to offer price stability for contracts that involve deferred
payments, even when currency exchange rates fluctuate constantly in
the speculative forex market? Can we invent ways to express stable
value with decentralized virtual currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and
Ripples (XRP) in spite of general currency system turbulence? Join us
to learn about, discuss, and explore new ways of approaching the
challenges and opportunities of open funding and open payment
protocols on the Web.
