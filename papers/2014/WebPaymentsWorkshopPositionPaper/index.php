  <h1><a id="a__Abstract" name="a__Abstract"></a>Abstract</h1>

  <p>The Web Payments Community Group provides an inclusive venue
  where web payment solutions, regardless of their origin, can be incubated,
  evaluated, refined, and tested. The focus of the group is to promote open Web
  payment innovations based primarily on their technical merit. Members of the
  group include Bloomberg, Mozilla, Yandex, Telefonica, Opera, Citigroup, UK
  Government Digital Service, Ripple Labs, and over 129 other people and
  organizations that are innovating payment solutions for the Web. The group
  brings together individuals with decades of payment experience and has
  identified key payment problem areas on the Web where standardization could
  greatly improve the speed, security, ease of use, and accuracy of financial
  transactions. The group would like to present the payment problem areas it
  has identified that could be helped by standardized solutions to the Web
  Payments Workshop participants. These problem areas include: Products,
  Transactions, Receipts, Identity, Payment Security, and Web Services.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Introduction" name=
  "a__Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

  <p class="P1"><span>The</span> <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/"><span>World Wide Web
  Consortium</span></a> <span>(W3C) is the organization that manages
  the architecture for the Web. 2.4 billion people around the world depend on
  the technology co-authored by many contributors under the guidance of the
  W3C. The consortium consists of organizations like Google, Bloomberg, Apple,
  PayPal, Mozilla, Facebook, Baidu, Yandex, Microsoft, and 392 other technology
  companies that are united in perpetually improving the Web. The W3C also
  utilizes more loosely organized Communities that are designed to feed new
  ideas and technologies into the W3C standardization process. This document
  outlines the findings of one of those groups named the Web Payments Community
  Group.</span></p>

  <p>The purpose of the Web Payments Community Group is to discuss,
  research, document, prototype and test web payment systems. This work is done
  in order to realize potential future standardization candidates and ensure
  interoperability between these solutions. The goal of the group is to forge a
  path for a secure, decentralized system of web payments that would empower
  both individual people and organizations on the Web to send and receive money
  as easily as they exchange instant messages and email today. In addition to
  documentation, this group collaborates on and shares various proof-of-concept
  solutions and components through open source methods, unencumbered by patents
  or royalties. The solutions developed by the Web Payments Community Group may
  be voted on by its membership to be standardized at W3C, IETF, or similar
  standards setting organizations.</p>

  <p>In general, the Web Payments Community Group provides an
  inclusive venue where web payment solutions, regardless of their origin, can
  be incubated, evaluated, refined, and tested. The focus of the group is to
  promote payment innovations based primarily on their technical merit. This
  approach invites competing technical designs to be submitted and incubated in
  the same group. The hope is that this strategy will lead to either the
  merging of the best aspects of each technical design, or a clear
  differentiation emerging between alternative designs.</p>

  <p>The group is conscious of the risks associated with disrupting
  live systems. We are also concerned with indirectly destabilizing the overall
  payment landscape through implied competition with long-running, legacy
  systems. We suggest that a the best strategy is to enable an elegant payments
  layer on the Web in cooperation with incumbent financial systems authorities.
  The ideal technology would be able to be deployed ubiquitously and
  non-disruptively, given that there is no prior standard for payments on the
  Web, and thus no legacy to replace. This layer should improve the experience
  of sending and receiving money while simultaneously creating a bridge between
  the fast-moving Web technology field and the deliberately slow-moving core
  financial systems field.</p>

  <p>If such Web Payments technology is successfully standardized
  via W3C, billions of people will have access to it as a core part of the Web
  via desktop computers, tablets, smartphones, and other Web-capable devices.
  They will have the power to undertake transactions with one another over the
  Internet far more efficiently than they do today. This has large implications
  for banks, financial institutions, governments, telecom operators, payment
  solution providers, technology companies, and organizations addressing
  socioeconomic issues such as poverty and broad access to banking services. In
  order to create such a system, it is important to understand the shortcomings
  of the web in the key areas described above.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__The_Promise_of_Web_Payments" name=
  "a__The_Promise_of_Web_Payments"></a>The Promise of Web Payments</h1>

  <p>The Web has fundamentally transformed the way the world's
  people and organizations publish and interact with information. However, the
  transmission of monetary value has not yet changed. The Webâ€™s foundation
  offers unrealized potential to transmit and receive funds with the same ease
  and rigor as sending and receiving email.</p>

  <p>Making payments on the Web simpler and more accessible has more
  than superficial advantages. By distributing to everyone the payment methods
  that have been traditionally only available to banks and large corporations,
  the world's economies can benefit from financial system changes that both
  reduce transaction costs and create new kinds of innovative e-commerce
  applications. The goal is not to just enable simpler payments, but also to
  spur innovation in capital formation that helps entrepreneurs of any size, in
  any location, earn a legitimate living.</p>

  <p>It is evident that whilst bringing new or powerful tools to the
  general public will foster competition and innovation, open Web payments can
  also bring about more basic societal change. The promise of Web payments is
  about more than just an exciting future, it is about one that is at the same
  time far more egalitarian, and far more efficient for businesses.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Aligning_Payments_with_the_Web" name=
  "a__Aligning_Payments_with_the_Web"></a>Aligning Payments with the Web</h1>

  <p>The Web flourishes when competition in a particular space is
  maximized. In order for competition to be maximized, solutions to a problem
  on the Web need to have good interoperability standards. There exist no such
  standards for transferring value on the Web. Sending money is not as simple
  as sending email because there is no common standard for it, and that's the
  biggest problem with payments on the Web.</p>

  <p>Standardization and decentralization are two of the primary
  drivers of innovation on the Web. You don't have to ask permission to publish
  your creation on the Web. Open Web standards such as HTTP and HTML ensure
  interoperability between applications. At the most basic level, the problem
  with payments on the Web are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Payment solutions are not decentralized, leading to vendor lock
    in.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no open, patent and royalty-free standard for payments on the
    Web.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Most payment solutions for the Web are not built on core Web
    architecture principles, like using URLs for identifiers which makes
    resources discoverable.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Many payment mechanisms don't allow anyone to implement the payment
    processor technology, or there are steep fees associated with being a
    payment processor.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Most payment solutions are not transparent with regard to their methods
    and processes for assurance, integrity, privacy, confidentiality,
    auditability, and reliability.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to these basic problems with payments on the Web,
  the Web Payments Community Group asserts that there are additional problems
  with payment technology on the Web:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The payment systems on the Web today do not enable choice among
    customers, vendors, and payment processors. As a result, healthy market
    competition suffers.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Current payment systems are not extensible in a decentralized way,
    allowing application-specific extensions to the core protocol without
    coordination.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Payment systems suffer from not being able to natively support higher
    order economic behaviors like crowdfunding and digitally executing legal
    contracts.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Many payment systems suffer from bad security design and do not use the
    latest security best practices to protect entire systems from
    attack.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>A number of newer payment systems do not take government concerns such
    as fair tax collection, a reporting infrastructure for central monetary
    authorities, money-laundering prevention, and anti-terrorism initiatives
    into account.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Many payment systems are not designed to be be truly currency agnostic
    with regard to central bank currencies (US Dollar, the Euro, and the
    Japanese Yen) and virtual currencies (e.g. Bitcoin and Ripple).&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Payment systems do not easily enable choice of vehicle currency and
    algorithmic pricing to support seamless commerce and stability in global
    markets. For example, this results in speculative FOREX trading having more
    of an effect on a vendor's prices than it should.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Payment solutions are typically tacked onto the back of the Web instead
    of being deeply integrated into it. This results in payment flows that are
    awkward to customers, harmful to vendors, and result in a higher level of
    fraud that is necessary for payment providers.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The rest of this paper digs deeper into the problems outlined
  above by examining five key areas where payments on the Web are suffering
  today.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Identity" name="a__Identity"></a>Identity</h1>

  <p>It is currently difficult to establish a verifiable identity on
  the Web. Since identity is one of the fundamental mechanisms that we use to
  trust the parties in a financial transaction, not having an identity solution
  for the Web is harming a good payments solution for the Web. The problems
  with identity for payments on the Web are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is no simple decentralized standard for asserting aspects of your
    identity on the Web.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Identities are not discoverable after you login to a website. For
    example, after you log in, there is no resolvable address that you can
    provide the website where it can discover more about you. Technologies like
    Persona are a step in the right direction, but more is needed for financial
    transactions.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>It is not possible to attach verifiable machine-readable information to
    an identity via 3rd parties. This means that Know Your Customer clearing is
    very difficult because there is no standard way to associate
    government-issued credentials, like an electronic passport, with your
    identity on the Web.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard access control mechanism to expose both public and
    private identity data to external sites, based on who is accessing the
    resource. A vendor cannot easily verify that a person is of legal age or
    licensed to purchase a particular item.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard secure digital signature and encryption mechanism
    for identity data.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In order for payments to become more trustworthy and secure on
  the Web, an identity solution that takes payment use cases into account must
  be created.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Transactions" name=
  "a__Transactions"></a>Transactions</h1>

  <p>The mechanisms that can be used on the Web to execute a
  transaction are varied, and as a result, it is both technically difficult and
  expensive for vendors to support a wide range payment mechanisms.
  Specifically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is no standard way for a vendor to initiate a purchase process
    via a Web browser. This leads to a different buy flow on most websites
    which can lead to side-effects like phishing opportunities that prey on a
    customer's unfamiliarity with the process.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard way for a vendor to send a purchase request to a
    payment processor that includes product and pricing information.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard response format to notify a vendor that a purchase
    was executed successfully.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A standard solution for initiating and verifying transactions
  could support both proprietary buy flows and open standard buy flows. By
  focusing on standardizing how a payment is initiated and how a payment is
  verified, the W3C could get both proprietary payment providers and open
  standard payment providers to agree on a common goal that would result in an
  improved payment process for everyone that uses the Web.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Products_and_Services" name=
  "a__Products_and_Services"></a>Products and Services</h1>

  <p>The data markup mechanism used by most vendors and payment
  providers today is not capable of expressing resources like people, places,
  events, goods, services, and a variety of other data in a standard
  machine-readable way. This data exists in the transaction chain, often on 3rd
  party websites, but is often lost during the course of a transaction. If
  payments on the Web are going to improve, the following product and service
  description issues must be addressed by Web payment standards:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is no standard mechanism to enable product descriptions to be
    easily machine-readable. If products can be described in a machine-readable
    way, and that data is retained during the lifecycle of a transaction, then
    it can be placed into a digital receipt at the end of the transaction. Once
    detailed machine-readable product information is placed into a digital
    receipt, the digital receipt becomes something that is more useful. For
    example, it could help the vendor perform more detailed analytics while
    enabling the customer to manage their expenses, file their taxes, and
    analyze their spending habits more accurately.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Pricing information is often tightly bound to product information on
    the Web, often in a way that is not machine-readable. Ideally, a product
    must be separable from the terms under which the sale occurs, enabling
    different prices to be associated with different product licenses,
    affiliate sales, and business models like daily deals.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>The creator of a product often cannot specify preferences on pricing,
    reseller restrictions, validity periods, and a variety of other properties
    associated with the sale of the product. This causes a great deal of manual
    labor and negotiation to be performed by both product manufacturers and
    vendors to get a product to market.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Product descriptions and the terms of sale do not support decentralized
    extensibility. Extensibility is important when certain market verticals
    need to add market-specific data, such as the purity of a metal, or the
    digital encoding format for a file, to the product description and terms of
    sale.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Product and service descriptions on the Web are not protected against
    modification after a sale has occurred. This makes it more difficult and
    costly for a buyer to challenge an unscrupulous vendor, or a vendor to
    assert that the product that a buyer requested was delivered.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>It is easy for a vendor to list counterfeit products for sale on the
    Web and then claim that they were not the source of the counterfeit goods.
    This sort of fraud could be reduced if product descriptions and the terms
    of sale were digitally signed by the vendor.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Often, content creators are forced to choose a centralized retailer and
    grant exclusivity to that retailer for the sale of their content. If
    products could be listed in a decentralized way, a content creator could
    express the terms under which they want their work to be sold, and
    retailers the world over could compete by using their networks to resell
    the good. This negotiation would be automatic due to the
    machine-readability of the product's distribution rules, as set by the
    content creator.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A solution to these problems would simultaneously reduce fraud,
  and increase competition, transaction speed and correctness.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Receipts_and_Contracts" name=
  "a__Receipts_and_Contracts"></a>Receipts and Contracts</h1>

  <p>Interoperability of commerce systems on the Web requires the
  clear machine-readable expression of digital receipts and contracts, but
  common standards for expressing these fundamental objects of commerce are not
  present today.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is currently no standard machine-readable mechanism on the Web to
    express an intent to purchase. As a result, it is difficult to signal to a
    person or organization that you would like to engage them in a
    transaction.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard machine-readable way of expressing a proof of
    purchase, digital receipt, or contract. Not having such a mechanism makes
    it difficult to link different financial systems, such as retail software,
    payment processors, accounting services, and regulatory systems
    together.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard machine-readable mechanism to include complex
    product information, licensing information, restrictions on use, or other
    details about the transaction into a digital receipt.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In order to enable interoperable commerce on the Web, a system
  of expressing purchase requests, digital contracts, and digital receipts
  should exist. The current state of only knowing if the payment went through,
  or having basic human-readable fields in the transaction history makes it
  impossible for the information to be useful outside of the payment systems
  that processed the payment.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Transaction_Security" name=
  "a__Transaction_Security"></a>Transaction Security</h1>

  <p>While there are large industry initiatives to detect and reduce
  fraudulent transactions on the Web, the fundamental way that most
  transactions are performed on the Web (the credit card and bank account
  transfer) were never designed for a connected world. In addition, the Web
  does not yet have a simple to implement, standard and robust security
  architecture that is capable of authenticating and verifying payment
  requests. The state of security on the Web with regard to payments creates
  the following problems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Credit card theft and identity theft are two of the major causes of
    fraud on the Web. This is primarily because information that should be
    private, such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and home
    addresses are unnecessarily leaked to vendors.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>There is no standard mechanism to digitally sign a purchase request,
    contract, or digital receipt on the Web. This makes it difficult to
    determine whether or not a purchase request originated from an account
    holder, or someone that has broken into the account holder's financial
    account.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Core web standards, such as HTTP, do not have a simple mechanism that
    enables web services to digitally sign important pieces of information,
    such as the headers and body of an HTTP message.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Public security audits for most financial transaction protocols on the
    Web are not available because the technology design is not open to public
    scrutiny. This leaves the state of security for most financial protocols on
    the Web as unknown.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In order to make payments more secure on the Web, it is
  necessary to extend some of the more fundamental Web protocols to provide
  greater security for financial transactions.</p>

  <h1><a id="a__Conclusion" name=
  "a__Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

  <p>The rate of innovation in payments has stagnated for a number
  of decades. Some say that the last major semi-open consumer innovation in
  payments was the credit card. It is only recently, with the advent of new
  financial protocols like Bitcoin and Ripple as well as a focus on making
  developer's lives easier by organizations like Stripe, Google, Balanced, and
  Square, has interest in payments been renewed. However, this progress has
  failed to make the core payments space more innovative as most of the new
  payment technology has either been proprietary, or has been done in the
  periphery, and thus has not changed average customer behavior in any sort of
  meaningful way. The entire market suffers as a result. Customers are charged
  higher fees for lackluster service. Vendors are charged higher fees than
  necessary and have increased implementation costs. Payment processors and
  financial service providers have higher operational costs due to identity and
  fraud issues.</p>

  <p>The Web Payments Community Group has identified all of the
  issues above as areas that could be addressed by simple Web standards and has
  forged ahead in an attempt to create solutions for the issues identified
  above. These solutions have been released under an open, patent and
  royalty-free W3C license, making them an ideal candidate as input documents
  to standardization. If invited to speak at the W3C Web Payments Workshop, the
  group would be happy to elaborate on the problem areas above and the path
  that it is taking to address these problem areas using technology that is
  both compatible with the Web, and is open to implement by anyone.</p>
