The purpose of the Web Payments group at the World Wide Web Consortium 
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C</a>)
is to create systems that enable people and businesses on the Web to send 
each other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and 
email today. The systems strive to be easy to use, currency agnostic, 
secure, decentralized and implementable by anyone in a patent and 
royalty-free manner. The group is focusing on transforming the way we reward
each other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.

The goal of this group is to create a set of universal payment
technologies for the Web, making single-click purchases and crowdfunding on the 
Web a reality, regardless of who your bank or financial institution is. It's 
like PayPal, only open, patent-free, and royalty-free.

Ripple is a peer-to-peer payment system. It lets you easily, cheaply, and 
safely send money over the Internet to anyone, anywhere in the world. 
Anyone can create an account. Because Ripple is P2P software, no individual, 
corporation, or government controls it. The network operates via the combined 
effort of the Ripple software running all over the world.
