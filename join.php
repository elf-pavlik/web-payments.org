The purpose of the Web Payments group at the World Wide Web Consortium 
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">W3C</a>)
is to create systems that enable people and businesses on the Web to send 
each other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and 
email today. The systems strive to be easy to use, currency agnostic, 
secure, decentralized and implementable by anyone in a patent and 
royalty-free manner. The group is focusing on transforming the way we reward
each other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.
