      <p>
Underlying most standards are a set of design principles that often capture not
only the technical considerations underpinning the system being created, but the
philosophical considerations that influenced the direction of the technology. This
document outlines the design principles and general philosophy behind the Web Payments
work. It is used to guide the standards making process behind the technology that
the group creates, and is meant to be a set of general guidelines rather than 
a set of prescriptive rules.

    <section id="broad-individual-empowerment">
      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Broad Individual Empowerment</h2>
      <p>
Technologies are often targeted, either willfully or accidentally, toward 
empowering a certain group of individuals. Speaking generally, patented 
technology primarily empowers the creators of that technology with secondary
empowerment coming to the consumers of the technology. Technologies, such as
the Web, primarily empower the individual with secondary gains coming to
large organizations that can capitalize on the core infrastructure
that the Web provides. The Web Payments technologies should focus on empowering 
the individual, local groups, and large organizations, in that order. 
      </p>
      <p>
In general, this means
choosing technologies that are not patented, and ensuring that all participants
in the Web Payments ecosystem are capable of performing the same activities
(within reason). There will be certain activities that will require licensing
of some kind or another. In these cases, solutions should be attempted that 
remove the need for acquiring the license in the first place while simultaneously
staying true to the local, federal, and world laws.
      </p>
      <p>
By focusing on individual empowerment, the hope is that certain side-effects
like increased competition, access to technology, and increased rates of
innovation can be achieved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="maximize-competition">
      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">2. </span>Maximize Competition</h2>
      <p>
Competition simultaneously drives innovation and commoditization of technology.
If the goal of the Web Payments group is to empower the individual and get the
technology to as many people as possible, then the standards must attempt to
maximize competition. Keep in mind that this is different from merely promoting
competition. For example, the standards could be written in such a way as to
only push banks to compete with each other. However, maximizing the competition 
would enable a larger group than just banks to compete in order to provide 
financial services to customers. Ultimately, the ideal scenario is that the
financial service is designed so that the individual doesn't need a 3rd party
to gain the benefit of the particular service.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="respectful-of-the-law">
      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">3. </span>Respectful of the Law</h2>
      <p>
In order to maximize the impact of the Web Payments technologies, they must
be compatible with a variety of (often conflicting) local, federal, and 
global laws. At no point should the group consider standardizing technologies to
enable the large-scale evasion of tax, money laundering, or funding of
illegal activities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="broadly-implementable">
      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">4. </span>Broadly Implementable</h2>
      <p>
Technologies standardized by the Web Payments group should be broadly 
implementable by software developers and engineers that are well-versed in
the art of programming. This also means that the need for software patents
and black-box modules should be avoided in the primary design of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
To be clear, this means that Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies should
not be employed in the primary payments system. However, it also means that
DRM systems may be layered on top of the payment system if a particular ecosystem
(such as the information security ecosystem) requires use of the DRM technology.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-portability">
      <!--OddPage--><h2><span class="secno">5. </span>Data Portability</h2>
      <p>
Part of promoting competition is ensuring that customers may switch from one
service provider to another in a standarized manner. Ideally, switching from one
provider to another should take as long as transferring data from the old
provider to the new one. In order to facilitate this migration, all important
transactional data should be designed to be easily moved from one provider to
another.
