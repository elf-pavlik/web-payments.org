W3C <a href="https://web-payments.org/">Web Payments Community Group</a>. All
feedback on this document should be sent to 
<a href="mailto:public-webpayments@w3.org">public-webpayments@w3.org</a>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This document outlines the technology stack and development timeline for the 
set of technologies being worked on by the Web Payments Community Group. It
is intended for those people that want to understand all of the technical
pieces being proposed, how they fit together, and the development timeline
for each technology.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
Readers should understand that this roadmap document is a work in progress
and while many of the technologies discussed in this document have been
implemented and are in production, others may be changed or modified heavily
if driven through a standardization track at W3C. This document is a proposed
roadmap, not the final roadmap for version 1.0.
      </p>
      <p>
A common question that's raised when someone is introduced to the Web Payments
work is whether or not a particular payment technology, like blockchain-based 
ledgers, are supported or whether their existence invalidates the specification 
stack that is being proposed. In general, the realization that the Web Payments 
Community Group has come to over the many years that it has been operating is 
that there will never be only one way of doing payments. Therefore, the 
specifications that are being proposed do not assume a single dominating payment
instrument or technology. Instead, the specifications focus on the more general
mechanisms that are required to express a transaction and not the specifics
that move value from one account to another. For example, the technology
proposed by this group primarily focuses on the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
The expression of digitally verifiable claims via credentials. For example,
proof-of-age, government-issued ID cards, corporate ID cards, 
proof-of-skillset, and other things necessary to fulfill Know Your Customer 
(KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
Machine-readable expression of product and service offers for sale via the Web.
For example, BigRecordsInc is selling SuperstarBand's new song One Hit Wonder 
for $5 USD.
        </li>
        <li>
Payment initiation on the Web which would allow browsers and other Web clients
to have one standardized way of initiating a payment that is payment instrument
and payment processor agnostic.
        </li>
        <li>
Digital receipts that would be able to be used as a proof-of-purchase and
would support multiple types of payment instruments and networks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
The Web Payments Community Group realizes the importance of supporting the 
current payment instruments that exist today (e.g. credit cards, ACH, 
electronic checks, etc.) as well as the established value benchmarks 
(e.g. WM Reuters Spot Rate) while also ensuring that the proposed technologies 
take other more future-facing solutions into account (e.g. blockchains, 
sidechains, smart contracts, DAOs, etc.) as well as new methods for 
algorithmic pricing and benchmarking. Rather than hard-coding each of these
technologies into the Web Payments specifications, we take a more 
general approach. Each one of these current and future systems and technologies 
is supported in a generic way in order to ensure that the specifications
remain as agnostic as possible to the underlying operation of each
payment instrument, value benchmark, and payment clearing technology.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
      <p>
The Web Payments technology stack is designed on generally accepted design
principles outlined for the Architecture of the World Wide Web[[WEBARCH]]. It
also heavily re-uses W3C and IETF technology, such as JSON-LD [[JSON-LD-SYNTAX]]
and HTTP [[RFC7230]]. A high-level diagram of the technology stack is shown 
below for reference:

<img id="diagram-stack" 
  style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; 
  max-height:100%; max-width:75%;" src="technologyStack.svg">

      </p>
      <p>
A description of the technologies shown in the diagram above is provided for 
those that may be unfamiliar with the technologies:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Javascript Object Notation [[RFC4627]]</dt>
        <dd>
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the serialization of 
structured data. JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, 
booleans, and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays). It is a
very popular format among Web developers.
        </dd>

        <dt>HyperText Transport Protocol [[RFC7230]]</dt>
        <dd>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a generic interface protocol for 
information systems.  It is
designed to hide the details of how a service is implemented by
presenting a uniform interface to clients that is independent of the
types of resources provided.  Likewise, servers do not need to be
aware of each client's purpose: an HTTP request can be considered in
isolation rather than being associated with a specific type of client
or a predetermined sequence of application steps.  The result is a
protocol that can be used effectively in many different contexts and
for which implementations can evolve independently over time.
        </dd>

        <dt>JSON for Linking Data [[JSON-LD-SYNTAX]]</dt>
        <dd>
JSON-LD is a lightweight syntax to serialize Linked Data in JSON [[RFC4627]]. 
Its design allows existing JSON to be interpreted as Linked Data with minimal 
changes. JSON-LD is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in 
Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, 
and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. 
        </dd>

        <dt>Signing HTTP Messages [[HTTP-SIGNATURES]]</dt>
        <dd>
When communicating over the Internet using the HTTP protocol, it can be 
desirable for a server or client to authenticate the sender of a particular 
message.  It can also be desirable to ensure that the message was not tampered 
with during transit.  The "Signing HTTP Messages" specification describes a 
way for servers and clients to simultaneously add authentication and message 
integrity to HTTP messages by using a digital signature.
        </dd>

        <dt>RDF Dataset Normalization [[RDF-NORMALIZATION]]</dt>
        <dd>
RDF (which JSON-LD uses) utilizes a graph-based data model for making claims 
about the world and provides the foundation for reasoning upon that graph 
of information. At times, it becomes necessary to compare the differences 
between graphs, digitally sign graphs, or generate short identifiers for 
graphs via hashing algorithms. RDF Dataset Normalization outlines an 
algorithm for normalizing RDF graphs such that these operations can be 
performed on the normalized graphs.
        </dd>

        <dt>Secure Messaging [[SECURE-MESSAGING]]</dt>
        <dd>
The Secure Messaging specification describes a simple, decentralized security 
infrastructure for the Web based on public key cryptography. This system 
enables Web applications to establish identities for agents on the Web, 
associate security credentials with those identities, and then use those 
security credentials to send and receive messages that are both encrypted 
and verifiable via digital signatures.
        </dd>

        <dt>Web Commerce [[WEB-COMMERCE]]</dt>
        <dd>
In order to support standardized commerce over the Web, it is vital that 
product offers and the result of purchases can be expressed in a simple 
manner. This specification enables the decentralized offer of products and 
services for sale and the transaction process resulting in a digitally 
verifiable receipt between the buyer and the vendor.          
        </dd>

        <dt>Identity Credentials [[IDENTITY-CREDENTIALS]]</dt>
        <dd>
An identity is a description of a particular entity such as a person, software 
agent, or organization. A credential is a qualification, achievement, quality, 
or information about an identity's background such as a name, government ID, 
home address, or university degree. The Identity Credentials specification 
describes mechanisms for reading credentials from and writing credentials to an 
identity while ensuring that the information is only accessible to 
authorized applications.          
        </dd>

        <dt>Web Commerce API [[WEB-COMMERCE-API]]</dt>
        <dd>
This specification outlines a browser polyfill that makes financial 
transactions easier to initiate and verify while also making them more secure. 
The solution is designed to work with both proprietary (PayPal, Google Wallet) 
and non-proprietary (PaySwarm, Bitcoin, Ripple) payment solutions.
        </dd>

      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <p>
The technologies proposed by the group are layered in such a way to allow the
base technologies to be re-used by other Web-based standards. Thus, there is
a natural order of progression in developing these technologies, from low-level
to high-level:
