The purpose of PaySwarm is to build payment into the core architecture of the 
Web. This document details the electronic commerce portion of this architecture; 
enabling the decentralized listing of assets for sale and the transaction of
those assets resulting in a digitally verifiable receipt between the buyer 
and the vendor.
      </p> 
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="issue">
Add introductory text about the need for a simple electronic commerce standard
for the Web.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>
There are three primary participants in a PaySwarm transaction; the 
buyer, the vendor, and the authority.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Vendors</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>vendor</tdef> is the entity providing an <tref>asset</tref> for sale. 
Typically, the vendor is the legal owner 
of the asset that is being listed for sale. Ownership of an asset can manifest 
in a variety of different forms. Copyright ownership, physical ownership, and 
sub-leased property or services are just a few of the types of ownership that 
apply to vendors.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Commerce Model</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Transactions</h4>
A <tdef>transaction</tdef> is the exchange of value from one or more 
source accounts into one or more destination accounts.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Assets</h4>
An <tdef>asset</tdef> describes a particular item that is provided as a part 
of a commercial
transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular license. Examples
of assets include web pages, crowd-funded loans or grants, music files, 
video streams, use of virtual machines by the hour, 
3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and many other items that are capable of being transacted.
          <p>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Licenses</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>license</tdef> is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a 
particular <tref>asset</tref>.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a contract to express what a buyer 
may do with the asset that has been purchased.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Listings</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>listing</tdef> describes the combination of an <tref>asset</tref> that 
is for sale under a specific <tref>license</tref> and a set of payment terms 
that must be fulfilled in order 
to access the <tref>asset</tref>. Listings are often published on websites that 
sell <tref>assets</tref> via PaySwarm as a way to express wares for sale in a 
decentralized manner.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Contracts</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>contract</tdef> is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm 
and contains
information such as the <tref>listing</tref>, the <tref>asset</tref> that was 
purchased, the parties involved in the transaction, the <tref>license</tref> 
outlining the rights to the <tref>asset</tref>, and payment information 
associated with the transaction.

      <h2>Base Technologies</h2>
      <p>
PaySwarm builds on a number of successful Internet and Web technologies. These
technologies are introduced in this section.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Representational State Transfer</h3>
        <p>
REpresentational State Transfer [[REST]] is the architectural style that underpins
the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of constraints to ensure that servers,
gateways, proxies and clients may interact in a way that is predictable.
Systems that are designed with this architecture in mind are called RESTful
systems. PaySwarm is designed to be RESTful by ensuring that the constraints of
REST are applied to all transactions performed via PaySwarm systems.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data</h3>
        <p>
JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data [[!JSON-LD]] is a lightweight Linked 
Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines 
to parse and generate. It is based on the already successful JSON format and 
provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. If you are already 
familiar with JSON, writing JSON-LD is very easy. There is a smooth migration 
path from the JSON you use today, to the JSON-LD you will use in the future. 
These properties make JSON-LD an ideal Linked Data interchange language for 
JavaScript environments, Web services, and JSON document-based databases.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Advanced Encryption Standard</h3>
        <p>
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [[!FIPS-197]] is a world standard 
adopted by the
United States Government and used to secure a vast majority of the
commercial transactions over the Internet via OpenSSL. Since much of the data
exchanged over PaySwarm participants is sensitive, it is important that a 
strong cryptography suite is utilized to digitally sign and transfer the 
messages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>HTML+RDFa</h3>
        <p>
Web sites are largely implemented on top of the HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML). This format is known to be fairly easy to author and publish on the Web.
In addition to being easy to publish, it is also important that data published
via HTML can be easily read by machines without placing an undue burden on
Web authors. Publishing structured data in a decentralized manner also 
requires a language that is capable of being both expressive and deterministic. 
The Resource Description Framework in attributes [[!RDFA-CORE]] extends HTML 
[[!HTML-RDFA]] to allow structured data to be expressed via HTML, but in a way 
that is easy for Web developers to author.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Purchase Process</h2>
      
      <p>
The simplest purchase process includes four distinct steps; publishing an
<tref>asset</tref>, publishing a <tref>license</tref>, publishing a 
<tref>listing</tref> and performing the purchase. Typically, the 
<tref>vendor</tref> publishes the <tref>asset</tref> description and the
<tref>listing</tref>. Anyone may publish a <tref>license</tref> that is used in 
a <tref>listing</tref>. The purchase is performed via a 
<tref>authority</tref>.
      </p>

        <p>
While it is possible to express <tref>asset</tref>s, <tref>license</tref>s,
and <tref>listing</tref>s on the Web in many different machine-readable 
formats, to ensure that implementations do not become more complicated than 
necessary, all <tref>asset</tref>s, <tref>license</tref>s and 
<tref>listing</tref> MUST be expressed in HTML+RDFa [[!HTML-RDFA]] format. The
example markup that is expressed in many of the following sections below
will use [[!JSON-LD]] for the sake of brevity. In many cases, the information
expressed via JSON-LD is expected to be express via RDFa on a Web page.
There is a clear mapping from RDFa to JSON-LD, so the data expressed in the

        <h3>Publishing an Asset</h3>
        <p>
An <tref>asset</tref> describes a particular item that is provided as a part 
of a commercial transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or 
acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular <tref>license</tref>. 
Examples of assets include web pages, music files, video streams, virtual 
machines intended to be paid for by the CPU-hour, 3D printer files for 
on-demand manufacturing, radio spectrum and crowd-funded loans and grants.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes a web page <tref>asset</tref> with the title 
"PaySwarm in Practice". The article was created by 
"Digital Bazaar, Inc." and the information in the asset is valid from 
November 28th, 2010 to November 28th, 2011. 
The asset is digitally signed by the organization providing it
and thus can be cached, stored and then presented to someone else in a manner
that is verifiable by the receiving party.

        </pre>

        <p>
It may not initially be clear why an <tref>asset</tref> would need to be
digitally signed. There are two major reasons that assets MUST be digitally
signed in order to take part in a secure financial system. The first is to
ensure, from a legal standpoint, that the person or organization claiming 
ownership over the asset is clear. The second is to ensure that forgery 
cannot occur on any of the asset information claimed by the owner of the asset.
For example, if the asset were listed on an non-secure HTTP-based Web site, 
the information could be easily modified in transit.
        </p>

        <p>
The example above demonstrates how the information expressed as [[!JSON-LD]] 
earlier in this section can be expressed as HTML+RDFa 
[[!HTML-RDFA]]. The rest of this specification will not express information 
using both mechanisms, but will use [[!JSON-LD]] markup for the sake of 
brevity even if the information being expressed is meant to be expressed in
RDFa.

        <h3>Publishing a License</h3>
        <p>
A <tref>license</tref> is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a 
particular <tref>asset</tref>.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a <tref>contract</tref> 
to express what a buyer may do with an asset that has been purchased. A license
can include a number of rights bestowed upon the licensesee as well as further
limitations on those rights. For example, how an asset may be
re-broadcast, how often a digital asset may be physically reproduced, what an 
asset may specifically not be used for, and liability limitations when using the 
asset are but a few of the rights and obligations expressible via a license.
        </p>
        
        <p>
The following example describes a very simple license for personal use.
        </p>
        <pre class="example prettyprint language-jsonld">
{
   "@context": "https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1",
   "id": "http://payswarm.example.com/licenses/personal-use",
   "type": "License",
   "format": "text/html",
   "licenseTemplate": "This personal use license allows you to save the 
      purchased asset onto any device that you own for your personal enjoyment
      and make up to &lt;span property=\"ex:physicalCopies\" /&gt; printed
      copies of the work for personal use."
   "licenseTerms": 
   {
      "ex:physicalCopies": 5
   }
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note">
<tref>License</tref>s do not need to be created for each site on the Web. In
many cases, common licenses can be placed on a website and re-used by a large
number of sites that sell assets under similar license terms.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a Listing</h3>

        <p>
A <tref>listing</tref> describes the combination of an <tref>asset</tref> 
that is for sale under a specific <tref>license</tref> and a set of payment 
terms that must be fulfilled in order to access the asset. Listings are often 
published on websites that sell assets via PaySwarm as a way to express things
that are for sale, in a decentralized manner.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes an <tref>asset</tref> for sale 
for $0.05 USD under a <tref>license</tref>
that covers acceptable use of blog posts. The offer is valid from March 2nd 
2011 to March 3rd 2011. The only restriction on additional payees is that the 
<tref>authority</tref> (the organization processing the payment) 
may only take a maximum of 10% of the final sale price to cover their fees.

        <h3>Performing a Purchase</h3>

        <p>
A normal purchase, as opposed to an automatic purchase, is typically performed
via a Web browser-based <tref>user agent</tref> when the <tref>participant</tref>
has never performed a purchase with the <tref>vendor</tref>'s website. The 
process consists of re-directing the Web browser to the buyer's PaySwarm
Authority for the purposes of authorizing payment to the vendor for a
particular <tref>listing</tref>. If a payment authorization is not approved,
the user agent is re-directed back to the vendor's website with an error.
If the payment authorization is approved, the user agent is re-directed back to
the vendor's website with a short-form <tref>contract</tref>, which 
is used as a proof-of-purchase for the vendor's listing.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Purchase Terms</h2>
          <p>
There are a number of terms that are used during the course of the purchase
process.
          <dl>
            <dt><tdef>listing hash</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
An identifier created by processing a <tref>listing</tref> expressed as
JSON-LD through the 
<a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/ED/20110911#normalization-1">JSON-LD 
Universal Graph Normalization Algorithm (UGNA2011)</a> and then generating a
SHA-1 hash of the result.
            </dd>
            <dt><tdef>purchase callback</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
An IRI that will be on the receiving end of an HTTP POST from the
<tref>authority</tref> with the result of a purchase request.
            </dd>
            <dt><tdef>reference identifier</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
A string value that MUST be greater than one character and less than 256
characters used by the <tref>vendor</tref> to track purchases. These 
identifiers can be used to ensure that <tref>asset</tref> that can be purchased 
multiple times, like game tokens, can be tracked by the vendor.
These identifiers also allow the vendor to protect against unintended
double-purchasing due to network failures.
            </dd>
            <dt><tdef>receipt</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
The resulting value of a purchase request, typically sent from the
<tref>authority</tref> to the <tref>publishing agent</tref>. The 
object typically contains a <tref>short-form contract</tref> as well as 
other information that may be pertinent to the transaction.

The normative algorithm for performing a purchase is expressed below.
        </p>
        
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
The <tref>publishing agent</tref> initiates a purchase request for a specific

                  <dt><code>nonce</code></dt>
                  <dd>
An optional cryptographic value that will be used in the encrypted response 
to the vendor. The response nonce is utilized to prevent replay attacks on
the vendor.

either an error message or a short-form <tref>contract</tref>:
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>
If the purchase was denied or failed for any reason, the authority

An automatic purchase is one where a <tref>vendor</tref> has been
previously authorized by a <tref>participant</tref> to perform purchases with
the buyer's pre-authorized consent. This is typically used when the 
<tref>vendor</tref> is trusted, or when the <tref>participant</tref> has set a 
spending limit with the <tref>vendor</tref> and does not want to be bothered
unless that spending limit is reached. Automatic purchases are designed to 
get out of the way of the <tref>participant</tref> and make the transactional flow
as friction-free as possible.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Purchase Terms</h2>
          <p>
There are a number of terms that are used during the course of the purchase
process.
          <dl>
            <dt><tdef>purchase request</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
A message consisting of a <tref>listing</tref> IRI, 
a <tref>listing hash</tref>, a <tref>participant</tref> identity IRI, and
an optional <tref>reference identifier</tref>. The message is typically sent
by a <tref>publishing agent</tref> to a <tref>participant</tref>'s 
<tref>authority</tref> for processing.

        <h3>The Automatic Purchase Algorithm</h3>
        
        <p>
The automatic purchase algorithm is outlined below:
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
The <tref>publishing agent</tref> prepares a <tref>purchase request</tref> by
constructing a JSON-LD message. The following pieces of information
MUST be expressed:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
              <dd>
A single value containing the string <code>https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1</code> 
or a list containing that context IRI as the first member, where subsequent 
context declarations MUST NOT override any values in the first member.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>type</code></dt>
              <dd>
The value <code>PurchaseRequest</code>.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>listing</code></dt>
              <dd>
An IRI to the <tref>listing</tref> that was purchased.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>listingHash</code></dt>
              <dd>
The SHA-1 hash of the <tref>listing</tref> information after being normalized 
using the <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/ED/20110911#normalization-1">JSON-LD 
Universal Graph Normalization Algorithm (UGNA2011)</a>.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>assetAcquirer</code></dt>
              <dd>
An IRI to the <tref>identity</tref> that acquired the <tref>asset</tref>.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>reference</code></dt>
              <dd>
The <tref>reference identifier</tref>, if one was suppied via the purchase 
request.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </li>        
          <li>
The <tref>purchase request</tref> is digitally signed by the 
<tref>publishing agent</tref> according to the
<a href="#request-signature-algorithm">Request Signature Algorithm</a> using
the <tref>private key</tref> associated with the <tref>listing</tref> in the
<tref>purchase request</tref>. The <tref>purchase request</tref> is
sent to the <tref>authority</tref> of the <tref>participant</tref>
via an HTTPS connection. The HTTPS protocol MUST be used for transmission 
of the request and retrieval of the response to prevent replay attacks.
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>authority</tref> checks to ensure that the
<tref>publishing agent</tref> is authorized to perform an automatic purchase 
on behalf of the provided <tref>participant</tref> identity IRI and responds to the
<tref>publishing agent</tref>:
          <ol class="algorithm">
            <li>
If the transaction fails, the exception details are placed into a JSON-LD 
message and sent to the <tref>publishing agent</tref>.
              <div class="issue">
Determine how PaySwarm will handle response exceptions.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
If the transaction is successful, a <tref>receipt</tref> is generated for
the <tref>publishing agent</tref>. The following fields MUST be
placed into the response:
              <dl>
                <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
                <dd>
A single value containing the string <code>https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1</code> 
or a list containing that context IRI as the first member, where subsequent 
context declarations MUST NOT override any values in the first member.
                </dd>
                  <dt><code>type</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The value <code>Receipt</code>.
                  </dd>
                <dt><code>contract</code></dt>
The contract used in the receipt is a summary of the digital contract that was
finalized via the <tref>authority</tref>. It includes the minimum
amount of information necessary for the <tref>publishing agent</tref> to 
correctly identify the <tref>listing</tref> that was transacted:
                <dd>
                  <dl>
                  <dt><code>type</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The value <code>Contract</code>.
                  </dd>
                  <dt><code>asset</code></dt>
                  <dd>
An IRI to the <tref>asset</tref> that was purchased.
                  </dd>
                  <dt><code>assetHash</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The SHA-1 hash of the <tref>asset</tref> information after being normalized

                  <dt><code>reference</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The <tref>reference identifier</tref>, if one was suppied via the purchase 
request.
                  </dd>
                  <dt><code>license</code></dt>
                  <dd>
An IRI to the <tref>license</tref> describing the rights associated with the
<tref>asset</tref> that was purchased.
                  </dd>
                  <dt><code>licenseHash</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The SHA-1 hash of the <tref>license</tref> information after being normalized

that digitally signed the <tref>listing</tref>. The encrypted receipt is
sent to the <tref>publishing agent</tref>.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
The <tref>publishing agent</tref> receives the response, which will either be
an exception or a receipt, and responds accordingly to the 
<tref>user agent</tref>.

        <h3>The Contract</h3>

        <p>
A <tref>contract</tref> is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm 
and contains information such as the <tref>listing</tref>, 
the <tref>asset</tref> that was purchased, the parties involved in the
transaction, the <tref>license</tref> outlining the rights to the 
asset, and payment information associated with the transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes a purchase that occurred on March 2nd 2011
for a Web-based article called "PaySwarm in Practice". The article was authored
and listed for sale by Bob Smith and a personal use license was acquired by 
Jane, who may now peruse the article.
