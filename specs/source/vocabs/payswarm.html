This document describes a number of classes and properties that can be used to 
express digital sales, rentals, contracts, licenses and payment-based
exchanges on the Web. These include things such as payments for
blog articles, video rentals, electronic magazine subscriptions, data vending, 
provisioning of Web services under legally enforceable contracts, 
and other novel business models that are powered by the universal
payment standard for the Web. This vocabulary is a part of the 
<a href="http://payswarm.com/">PaySwarm Universal Web Payment Specifications</a>.

        <h3>Asset</h3>
        <p>
An asset describes a particular item that is provided as a part of a commercial
transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular license. Examples
of assets include web pages, music files, video streams, use of virtual
machines by the hour, 3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and many other items that are capable of being transacted.

The following example describes a web page asset with the title "PaySwarm
in Practice - Full Article #1". The article was created by "Digital Bazaar, 
Inc." and the information in the asset is valid from November 28th, 2010 to
November 28th, 2011. The asset is digitally signed by the person providing it
and thus can be cached, stored and then presented to someone else in a manner
that is verifiable by the receiving party.

associated item. This is typically used when an asset owner does not want 
anyone else on the network to provide value-added services on top of their

        <h3>assetHash</h3>
        <p>
An asset hash is used as a unique identifier for a graph of asset information.
These hashes exist so that the asset provider can refer to the asset by the
hash instead of having to re-transmit the entire asset when communicating with
a PaySwarm Authority. The hashes also provide a checksum on asset information
such that both the asset provider and PaySwarm Authority know that each is
talking about the same asset when the hash is used in Web service calls. Asset
hash information MAY be used to make <a href="#Asset">Asset</a> caching decisions by a PaySwarm
Authority. The asset hash is generated by following this algorithm:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
Encode the <a href="#Asset">Asset</a> sub-graph in JSON-LD normalized form.
          </li>
          <li>Generate a SHA-1 on the JSON-LD normalized form.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
When generating an asset hash, the following features MUST NOT exist in the
Asset graph:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Graph cycles, which will result in non-deterministic 
serialization of the graph.</li>
          <li>Named Blank Nodes, such as <code>_:bn1</code>, which will result 
in non-deterministic serialization due to the generation of potentially 
different Blank Node names.</li>

An asset provider is the entity providing an asset for sale. Typically, the

Ownership of an asset can manifest in a variety of different forms. 
Copyright ownership, physical ownership, and sub-leased property or services
are just a few of the types of ownership that allow one to be listed as a
ps:assetProvider.

the number of times a document may be physically reproduced

The ps:licenseTemplate is frequently used in combination with the

        <h3>identityHash</h3>
        <p>
The identity hash is used to provide a means of identifying an individual that
is a participant in a sale, but in a way that does not violate their privacy.
At times, an asset acquirer may need to prove to a court of law that an 
asset provider has broken the terms of a license in a contract. For instance,
this may need to happen if the asset aquirer is seeking damages from the
asset provider. PaySwarm 
protects identities by encrypting data such as address information and names 
in contracts. This ensures that even if a contract is posted to the Internet, 
it will be nearly impossible to discover the names and addresses of the 
participants in the contract if the participants do not want that information
to be known. Instead of including real names and addresses in the PaySwarm
contracts, an identityHash is calculated and included in the contract.
</p>
<p>
The identity hash is generated by performing the following hashing algorithm:
        </p>
<ol>
<li>Collect the formatted name for the person as well as the primary address
for the individual.</li>
<li>Convert the information to lower-case if it is supported in the 
character set for the language.</li>
<li>Generate a random 6-byte identity salt.</li>
<li>Concatenate the formatted name, address and identity salt together.</li>
<li>Perform a SHA-1 hash of the information, the result is the identityHash
value.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The identity hash is only used for asset providers and only those providers 
that are providing an asset other than data. If an asset provider is providing 
raw data, then it is assumed that they have implicitly given access to that 
data. There are no rights involved other than the data access itself and the 
contract is considered fairly temporal. 
</p>
<p>If the asset provider is not providing data then they are providing rights 
to an asset where the creator of that asset is known. However, the home address 
of that person is not necessarily known. If the home address of the asset
provider is a matter of public record then the identityHash scheme cannot
reliably protect that knowledge. This means that a person's address can be 
determined just from their name anyway, even without using PaySwarm. 
</p>
<p>
However, if an asset provider's address is not a matter of public record, 
the identityHash scheme protects that entity's address because the set of all 
addresses where an entity has resided are not available and are thus much
harder to crack using a brute force attack. It is true though, that all 
addresses where that entity might have lived within an entire state or 
country might be available. If that is the case, it is typically not feasible
to try every possible address in the region because the number of permutations
are too high. 
</p>
<p>
That is, if the entity's information has ever been made public, then it's 
likely easier to check public records than it is to crack the identityHash
for a PaySwarm contract. Since CPU power will continue to improve over time, 
an implementation must ensure that it is sufficiently difficult to test the 
sufficiently small set of addresses that an attacker believes an entity 
has resided.
</p>

<p>
In order ensure that a brute force attack remains infeasible, 
a random number is appended to the identity data that is hashed. This approach
is nearly identical to the concept of a salt, except that this salt does not 
just protect against dictionary attacks, it protects against computational 
attacks because the salt is kept secret. In practice, the salt is thrown away
after use. The salt can be discarded because, in the event of a court order to
perform discovery on the participants involved in a contract, there will be a 
very small data set to search. The small data set is relative to the 
"guess set" a brute force attacker would have to use to look for a hash match. 
</p>

<p>
A court of law attempting to discover the identity of a contract participant can 
test all random numbers (possible salts) along with each address 
in the set for the entity that is a part of the case. The random number 
should be sufficiently small that a program can test identities when 
subpoenaed but sufficiently large to thwart brute-force attacks. The random
number can increase in range with time as CPU power increases. Note that this 
test only needs to be run if the PaySwarm authority involved has ceased to
exist or records of the purchase no longer exist.

The license specifies a URL where the rights to an asset are described. 
Licenses are typically included in a <a href="#Listing">Listing</a> to express the rights that 
are conferred upon purchase. Licenses are also included in contracts to
express the rights that govern the access and use of the asset. The value of
this property is typically a URL which expresses a ps:licenseTemplate using
HTML+RDFa or other human-readable semantic web markup language.

A listing hash is a checksum for the contents of a listing. Technically, it is
a cryptographic hash of the graph information expressed in JSON-LD. To 
calculate a listing hash, the entire ps:listing sub-tree without any
ps:signature values is normalized via standard JSON-LD normalization rules and
then the SHA-1 hashing algorithm is performed on the result.
