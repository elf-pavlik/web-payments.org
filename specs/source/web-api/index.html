The PaySwarm Web platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm enables the people that 
create digital content such as blog posts, music, film, episodic content, 
photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their creations through 
their website and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. The 
technology is designed to be integrated directly into blogging platforms, 
content management systems and general purpose websites. The standard can
be applied to the entire content distribution lifecycle, from asset description, 
to product listings, to licenses, contracts and financial transactions. 
Features include the ability to exchange money, transact individual sales, 
subscriptions and micropayments.

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The PaySwarm Web platform is an open web standard that enables Web browsers and 
Web devices to perform Universal Web Payment. PaySwarm enables the people that 
create digital content such as blog posts, music, film, episodic content, 
photos, virtual goods, and documents to distribute their creations through 
their website and receive payment directly from their fans and customers. The 
technology is designed to be integrated directly into blogging platforms, 
content management systems and general purpose websites.
      </p>
      <p>
The technology is provided as an open web platform, which is a combination of 
technology that is patent-free, royalty-free, published in a free 
specification, using well-defined protocols and other open technologies. The 
entire PaySwarm standard, like HTML, HTTP, and JavaScript, is an open web 
platform. Almost every successful Web technology is built and released in 
this way.
      </p>      
      <p>
PaySwarm supports Micropayments. The standard assumes that customers do not
want to be bothered to reach for their wallet every time they need to spend a 
couple of cents, or even a couple of dollars. Micropayment in this case, 
specifically refers to the ability to automatically distribute payments in 
increments of up to 1/100,000th of a cent to anybody listed in PaySwarm 
digital contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
It is the goal of this specification to create an environment that is friendly
to content creators and customers alike. Distribution of digital goods is
becoming an increasing part of the Web and therefore compensation for these
digital goods must be as easy to perform as downloading the digital goods. The
PaySwarm specification works with the architecture of the Web to deliver a
solution that is universal across websites, industries and countries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>
There are three primary participants in a PaySwarm transaction; the 
buyer, the vendor, and the authority.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Identity and Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
In order for a universal payment system to work seamlessly, there must be a
universal way of identifying <em>things</em> in the environment. This 
specification uses Internationalized Resource Identifiers [[!IRI]] to 
refer to <em>things</em> on the network. These things can be a personal identity 
(<code>https://example.com/people/bob</code>), 
financial account information 
(<code>https://example.com/people/bob/accounts/42</code>), public cryptography
keys (<code>https://example.com/people/bob/keys/14</code>), assets, licenses 
and a variety of other pieces of long-lived information that exists on the Web. 
By naming these things with long-lived unique identifiers, it becomes possible 
to create a decentralized but stable universal payment architecture.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Agent</h4>
          <p>
An <tdef>agent</tdef> is any software that is capable of requesting an action
to be performed in a way that is compliant with the PaySwarm specification.
The software is usually controlled by a person or an organization 
that would like to perform some action on a PaySwarm-conformant network.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Participants</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>participant</tdef> is an entity that is capable 
of performing a transaction or acquiring the rights to a particular 
<tref>asset</tref> via a <tref>contract</tref>. 
The entity is typically a person or an organization that would like to 
transact, view, copy or otherwise utilize an asset that is being 
sold.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Vendors</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>vendor</tdef> is the entity providing an <tref>asset</tref> for sale. 
Typically, the vendor is the legal owner 
of the asset that is being listed for sale. Ownership of an asset can manifest 
in a variety of different forms. Copyright ownership, physical ownership, and 
sub-leased property or services are just a few of the types of ownership that 
apply to vendors.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>PaySwarm Authorities</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>authority</tdef> is used to store money, process and store 
contracts, and 
transfer monetary amounts between financial accounts. While a PaySwarm 
Authority may hold a great deal of financial data, they are built with
data portability in mind. PaySwarm participants may move their money and
purchase history from one authority to another. Data portability is a mandatory
part of this specification.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Commerce Model</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Transactions</h4>
A <tdef>transaction</tdef> is the exchange of value from one or more 
source accounts into one or more destination accounts.
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Assets</h4>
An <tdef>asset</tdef> describes a particular item that is provided as a part 
of a commercial
transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular license. Examples
of assets include web pages, crowd-funded loans or grants, music files, 
video streams, use of virtual machines by the hour, 
3D printer files for on-demand manufacturing, radio 
spectrum and many other items that are capable of being transacted.
          <p>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Licenses</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>license</tdef> is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a 
particular <tref>asset</tref>.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a contract to express what a buyer 
may do with the asset that has been purchased.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Listings</h4>
          <p>
A <tdef>listing</tdef> describes the combination of an <tref>asset</tref> that 
is for sale under a specific <tref>license</tref> and a set of payment terms 
that must be fulfilled in order 
to access the <tref>asset</tref>. Listings are often published on websites that 
sell <tref>assets</tref> via PaySwarm as a way to express wares for sale in a 
decentralized manner.
          </p>

A <tdef>contract</tdef> is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm 
and contains
information such as the <tref>listing</tref>, the <tref>asset</tref> that was 
purchased, the parties involved in the transaction, the <tref>license</tref> 
outlining the rights to the <tref>asset</tref>, and payment information 
associated with the transaction.

      <h2>Base Technologies</h2>
      <p>
PaySwarm builds on a number of successful Internet and Web technologies. These
technologies are introduced in this section.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Representational State Transfer</h3>
        <p>
REpresentational State Transfer [[REST]] is the architectural style that underpins
the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of constraints to ensure that servers,
gateways, proxies and clients may interact in a way that is predictable.
Systems that are designed with this architecture in mind are called RESTful
systems. PaySwarm is designed to be RESTful by ensuring that the constraints of
REST are applied to all transactions performed via PaySwarm systems.

        <h3>JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data</h3>
        <p>
JavaScript Object Notation for Linking Data [[!JSON-LD]] is a lightweight Linked 
Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines 
to parse and generate. It is based on the already successful JSON format and 
provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. If you are already 
familiar with JSON, writing JSON-LD is very easy. There is a smooth migration 
path from the JSON you use today, to the JSON-LD you will use in the future. 
These properties make JSON-LD an ideal Linked Data interchange language for 
JavaScript environments, Web services, and JSON document-based databases.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Advanced Encryption Standard</h3>
        <p>
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [[!FIPS-197]] is a world standard 
adopted by the
United States Government and used to secure a vast majority of the
commercial transactions over the Internet via OpenSSL. Since much of the data
exchanged over PaySwarm participants is sensitive, it is important that a 
strong cryptography suite is utilized to digitally sign and transfer the 
messages.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>HTML+RDFa</h3>
        <p>
Web sites are largely implemented on top of the HyperText Markup Language 
(HTML). This format is known to be fairly easy to author and publish on the Web.
In addition to being easy to publish, it is also important that data published
via HTML can be easily read by machines without placing an undue burden on
Web authors. Publishing structured data in a decentralized manner also 
requires a language that is capable of being both expressive and deterministic. 
The Resource Description Framework in attributes [[!RDFA-CORE]] extends HTML 
[[!HTML-RDFA]] to allow structured data to be expressed via HTML, but in a way 
that is easy for Web developers to author.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
All communication between software operating under this specification is
intended to perform according to REST [[REST]] principles. Additionally, since
PaySwarm implements a financial system, the security of messages and data
is of paramount importance. A security breach at certain points during the 
algorithms described in the following sections may introduce attack vectors 
that criminals could utilize to steal from or cause financial harm to the 
systems or people involved. However, excellent security does not have to 
come at a high cost. PaySwarm has been designed so that many parts of the 
system can be implemented in a way that does not incur significant 
effort, recurring costs, or financial outlay.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Requests and Responses</h2>
        <p>
This specification requires that a <tref>authority</tref> 
have a trusted security certificate and operate many of the API services over 
Transport Layer Security version 1.0 or later. Unless otherwise 
specified, all API requests
MUST be made over HTTPS to the <tref>authority</tref>.
        </p>
        <p>
An invalid certificate or TLS error of any kind MUST result in the API 
call exiting immediately and not performing the requested
action. All API requests sent to the <tref>authority</tref> on 
behalf of a participant of the network that results in any modification 
to an internal database MUST be digitally signed by the requestor using the
steps provided in the <a href="#request-signature-algorithm">Request Signature
Algorithm</a>. All responses to network participants from a
<tref>authority</tref> MUST be encrypted according to the steps
provided in the
<a href="#response-encryption-algorithm">Response Encryption Algorithm</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Communication Terms</h2>
        <p>
The following terminology is used to describe concepts used to generate and 
secure messages in the system. Many of these terms are borrowed from 
public/private key cryptography. A more complete description of public/private 
cryptography can be found in The Advanced Encryption Standard [[AES]].

        <h2>Request Signature Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
The following algorithm ensures that the originator of an API call can be
verified as long as the public key can be retrieved by the receiver. A
<tref>message</tref> is provided as input and, using a
<tref>private key</tref> and a <tref>public key</tref> IRI, a

        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>
Since this specification describes a financial system, the security of the
communication in the system is of utmost importance. The following section
describes security considerations that developers implementing this 
specification should be aware of in order to create secure software.
        </p>

        <section>
        <h3>The Response Token</h3>        
          <p>
The <code>sec:responseToken</code> mechanism is used in order to prevent
replay attacks, but implementers must be aware that it is not capable of 
preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. Only a full end-to-end encryption channel
is capable of accomplishing that feat and if implementers are concerned about
man-in-the-middle attacks, they are strongly advised to run all callbacks
over HTTPS.
          </p>
          <p>
While implementation of the response 
token to prevent replay attacks is left as an exercise to the developer, it
is advised that it is treated as a one-time token. That is, when a response
token is sent from one peer to another peer, the sender must note the
response token in an internal database. When the response token is returned in
an encrypted message, the response token must be deleted from the internal
database so all successive calls using the same response token will fail.
This simple behavior prevents replay attacks and is simpler to implement than
a security nonce.
          </p>
          <p>
To further increase security, it is advised that the response token is tied to
the originating client's IP address in some way. The resulting response callback
should be executed by the same client's IP address, thus many classes of 
man-in-the-middle attacks can be prevented, requiring quite a sophisticated 
attack in order to hijack the response. Note that the hijacker will not be able 
to modify the response, but merely callback-jack the response. The result of
the callback-jack would be fairly benign in most cases - gaining access
to an article that was purchased by the original user agent that initiated
the request. The original purchaser will still have access
to the article, so the only damage done is the ability to view or download an
article as someone else. If this is a concern to implementers, they are advised
to purchase a valid SSL certificate and ensure that all callbacks to their site
occur over SSL.

There are a number of terms that are used during the course of the registration
process.
        <dl>
        <dt><tdef>user agent</tdef></dt>
        <dd>The piece of software operating on behalf of the 
<tref>participant</tref>. This is typically a Web Browser, but could be
some other piece of Web-aware automated software acting on behalf of a 
person.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>publishing agent</tdef></dt>
        <dd>A software agent acting on behalf of the <tref>vendor</tref>
that publishes <tref>asset</tref>s for sale. Typically, this is blogging
software, content distribution software, online merchant software or a Web-based
game.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>configuration service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>A Web service that is used to publish the public Web service
end-points and other public configuration information for a
<tref>authority</tref>. An <tref>authority</tref> MUST
publish this service at a top-level IRI named <code>payswarm-v1-config</code>. 
The document MUST be available in JSON-LD compacted form and MUST use the
<code>https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1</code> JSON-LD context. The following
keys MUST be present in the published document; 
<code>ps:publicKeyService</code>, <code>ps:licenseService</code>, and
<code>ps:transactionService</code>.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>public key registration service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>An interactive Web service used to register PEM-encoded 
X.509 public keys with the <tref>authority</tref>.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>license service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>A utility service is used by a <tref>publishing agent</tref>s 
to retrieve license hashes, which are used when listing <tref>asset</tref>s 
for sale.</dd>
        <dt><tdef>contracts service</tdef></dt>
        <dd>The contract service is used to process purchases by submitting
and retrieving digital contracts.</dd>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Buyer Registration</h2>
        <p>
In order for a <tref>participant</tref> to transact, they must have an
account on a <tref>authority</tref>. Typically, this account must 
also contain a positive amount of funds that may be used to acquire goods or 
services. How this account is created and funds are deposited are outside of
the scope of this specification. However, the end result of this sign up
process MUST result in the following items being created for the
<tref>participant</tref>:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>An <tdef>identity</tdef> IRI that will be used to identify the 
entity that is transacting. For example: 
<code>https://example.com/people/jane</code>.</li>
          <li>A <tdef>financial account</tdef> IRI that is associated with the 
<tref>identity</tref> IRI above. For example:
<code>https://example.com/people/jane/accounts/primary</code>.</li>
          <li>A positive amount of funds in the <tref>financial account</tref>
mentioned above.
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Vendor Registration</h2>
        <p>
In order for a <tref>vendor</tref> to transact, they must have an
account on a authority. How this account is created and managed is
outside of the scope of this specification. However, the end result of this
sign up process MUST result in the following items being created for the 
<tref>vendor</tref>:
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>An <tdef>identity</tdef> IRI that will be used to identify the 
entity that is transacting. For example: 
<code>https://example.com/people/manu</code>.</li>
          <li>A <tdef>financial account</tdef> IRI that is associated with the 
<tref>identity</tref> IRI above. For example:
<code>https://example.com/people/manu/accounts/article-sales</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
Since all <tref>asset</tref>s and <tref>listing</tref>s are digitally signed,
a public key MUST be registered for the 
<tref>vendor</tref> with the <tref>authority</tref>.
This is typically performed by the <tref>publishing agent</tref> software that 
is publishing the 
<tref>asset</tref>s and <tref>listing</tref>s for sale on behalf of the 
<tref>vendor</tref>. The registration is accomplished by executing
the following algorithm:
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>The <tref>publishing agent</tref> generates and stores a 
public/private keypair that will be used to associate the
<tref>publishing agent</tref> with the <tref>vendor</tref>.</li>
          <li>The <tref>publishing agent</tref> retrieves the 
<tref>authority</tref> configuration from the 
<tref>configuration service</tref> IRI</tref>.
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>The <tref>configuration service</tref> IRI is generated 
by concatenating a base IRI for the <tref>authority</tref>, 
such as <code>https://example.com/</code> with the 
<code>payswarm-v1-config</code> suffix. 
For example, the previous <tref>authority</tref> IRI concatenated 
with the configuration suffix would result in the following 
<tref>configuration service</tref>
IRI: <code>https://example.com/payswarm-v1-config</code>.</li>
              <li>An HTTPS GET is performed on the 
<tref>configuration service</tref> IRI with the
HTTP <code>Accept</code> header set to 
<code>application/ld+json; form=compacted</code>. The
<tref>authority</tref> MUST respond with a compacted JSON-LD document
using the context specified at <code>https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1</code>.</li>
              <li>The result MUST be a JSON-LD document containing a flat set of
key-value pairs defined in the <tref>configuration service</tref> section above.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>publishing agent</tref> initiates an HTTP 302 redirect
for the <tref>user agent</tref>. An HTTPS GET request is performed
to the <tref>public key registration service</tref> IRI with the addition of 
two IRI query parameters. The first parameter, <code>public-key</code>, is the 
URL-encoded X.509 PEM-encoded public key. The second parameter, 
<code>registration-callback</code>,
is the URL-encoded <tref>registration callback service</tref> 
IRI for the <tref>publishing agent</tref>.</li>
          <li>
The <tref>authority</tref> associates the 
<tref>publishing agent</tref> with the <tref>vendor</tref> based on the
provided public key. Note that this process MUST authenticate the 
<tref>vendor</tref> via a login process if the 
<tref>vendor</tref> does not have an active login session. Other
configuration steps may be performed at this stage, including the 
specification of defaults for the particular <tref>publishing agent</tref>.</li>
          <li>
The <tref>authority</tref> specifies a set of 
<tref>publishing agent</tref> configuration values and encrypts the 
<tref>message</tref> according to the steps outlined in
the <a href="#response-encryption-algorithm">Response Encryption Algorithm</a>
section. The result is sent 
back to the <code>registration-callback</code> IRI via a POST 
initiated by the <tref>user agent</tref>.
            <ol class="algorithm">
              <li>The following configuration values MUST be included in the
JSON-LD response to the <tref>publishing agent</tref>; 
<code>com:currency</code>, <code>com:minimumAmount</code>, 
<code>com:maximumRate</code>, <code>com:destination</code>, 
<code>sec:publicKey</code>, <code>ps:license</code> and 
<code>ps:licenseHash</code>.
              </li>
              <li>The JSON-LD response is compacted and encrypted using the
public key associated with the registration request according to the
algorithm defined in
<a href="#response-encryption-algorithm">Response Encryption Algorithm</a>.
              </li>
              <li>The <tref>encrypted response</tref> is transmitted to the
<code>registration-callback</code> via an HTTP POST request that is initiatited
by the <tref>user agent</tref>. This is most commonly accomplished by having
the <tref>authority</tref> generate an HTML form that can be submitted
to the <tref>publishing agent</tref> when a form submission button is clicked
via the <tref>user agent</tref>.
              <li>The <tref>publishing agent</tref> decrypts the base-64
encoded byte stream, extracts the configuration values and stores each value
for use during the latter parts of the publishing and purchase process.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
The example below shows the full protocol-level exchange between the
<tref>publishing agent</tref> and the <tref>authority</tref>. For
the sake of brevity, not every optional parameter is included, just the bare
minimum necessary to perform the <tref>vendor</tref> registration.

        <h3>The Transaction Algorithm</h3>

        <p>
There are two ways in which a Transaction may be initiated via a 
<tref>authority</tref>; Payment Link initiated and <tref>agent</tref>
initiated. The first approach is where a <tref>publishing agent</tref> may 
initiate a transaction by constructing a URL targeted to the 
<tref>authority</tref>'s <tref>transaction service</tref> using the 
<a href="http://payswarm.com/specs/source/payment-links/">Payment Links specification</a>. 
The second approach is where an <tref>agent</tref> may initiate a transaction by
performing an HTTPS POST of JSON-LD object expressing a
<code>ps:Transaction</code>. The normative algorithm for performing this
operation is detailed below. In both approaches, the 
<tref>authority</tref> processing the request MUST note the 
<code>ps:Transaction</code> entry in all of the accounts associated in the 
<tref>transaction</tref> and ensure that all accounts external to the 
<tref>authority</tref> are notified via the 
<a href="#decentralized-settlement-algorithm">Decentralized Settlement Algorithm</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The normative algorithm for performing an <tref>agent</tref>-initiated 
transaction is expressed below.
        </p>
        
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
An <tref>agent</tref> MUST construct a <tref>transaction request</tref> in
JSON-LD format containing at least the following:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
              <dd>
A single value containing the string <code>https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1</code> 
or a list containing that context IRI as the first member, where subsequent 
context declarations MUST NOT override any values in the first member.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>@type</code></dt>
              <dd>
The value <code>ps:Transaction</code>.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>com:transfer</code></dt>
              <dd>
One or more <tref>transfer</tref>s in JSON-LD format containing at least the 
following:
                <dl>
                  <dt><code>@type</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The value <code>ps:Transfer</code>.
                  </dd>        
                  <dt><code>com:amount</code></dt>
                  <dd>
A string value of the total amount of the transfer.
                  </dd>        
                  <dt><code>com:currency</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The currency associated with the amount of the transfer. The value MUST be an 
ISO-4217 currency or a dereference-able IRI to a monetary system that is 
not specified in ISO-4217 but follows the specification of a 
<a href="">Currency Mint</a>.
                  </dd>        
                  <dt><code>com:source</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The source account from which the funds listed in <code>com:amount</code> will

              <dt><code>com:currency</code></dt>
              <dd>

      <h2>The Purchase Process</h2>
      
      <p>
The simplest purchase process includes four distinct steps; publishing an
<tref>asset</tref>, publishing a <tref>license</tref>, publishing a 
<tref>listing</tref> and performing the purchase. Typically, the 
<tref>vendor</tref> publishes the <tref>asset</tref> description and the
<tref>listing</tref>. Anyone may publish a <tref>license</tref> that is used in 
a <tref>listing</tref>. The purchase is performed via a 
<tref>authority</tref>.
      </p>

        <p>
While it is possible to express <tref>asset</tref>s, <tref>license</tref>s,
and <tref>listing</tref>s on the Web in many different machine-readable 
formats, to ensure that implementations do not become more complicated than 
necessary, all <tref>asset</tref>s, <tref>license</tref>s and 
<tref>listing</tref> MUST be expressed in HTML+RDFa [[!HTML-RDFA]] format. The
example markup that is expressed in many of the following sections below
will use [[!JSON-LD]] for the sake of brevity. In many cases, the information
expressed via JSON-LD is expected to be express via RDFa on a Web page.
There is a clear mapping from RDFa to JSON-LD, so the data expressed in the 
sections below can be losslessly expressed via RDFa on an HTML Web page.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing an Asset</h3>
        <p>
An <tref>asset</tref> describes a particular item that is provided as a part 
of a commercial transaction. It is usually an item that can be accessed or 
acquired on the
basis of a sale or rental under the terms of a particular <tref>license</tref>. 
Examples of assets include web pages, music files, video streams, virtual 
machines intended to be paid for by the CPU-hour, 3D printer files for 
on-demand manufacturing, radio spectrum and crowd-funded loans and grants.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes a web page <tref>asset</tref> with the title 
"PaySwarm in Practice". The article was created by 
"Digital Bazaar, Inc." and the information in the asset is valid from 
November 28th, 2010 to November 28th, 2011. 
The asset is digitally signed by the organization providing it
and thus can be cached, stored and then presented to someone else in a manner
that is verifiable by the receiving party.
        </p>

 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
        </pre>

        <p>
It may not initially be clear why an <tref>asset</tref> would need to be
digitally signed. There are two major reasons that assets MUST be digitally
signed in order to take part in a secure financial system. The first is to
ensure, from a legal standpoint, that the person or organization claiming 
ownership over the asset is clear. The second is to ensure that forgery 
cannot occur on any of the asset information claimed by the owner of the asset.
For example, if the asset were listed on an non-secure HTTP-based Web site, 
the information could be easily modified in transit.
        </p>

        <p>
The example above demonstrates how the information expressed as [[!JSON-LD]] 
earlier in this section can be expressed as HTML+RDFa 
[[!HTML-RDFA]]. The rest of this specification will not express information 
using both mechanisms, but will use [[!JSON-LD]] markup for the sake of 
brevity even if the information being expressed is meant to be expressed in
RDFa.
        </p>
        
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a License</h3>
        <p>
A <tref>license</tref> is a legal description of a licensee's rights to a 
particular <tref>asset</tref>.
Licenses are usually included as a part of a <tref>contract</tref> 
to express what a buyer may do with an asset that has been purchased. A license
can include a number of rights bestowed upon the licensesee as well as further
limitations on those rights. For example, how an asset may be
re-broadcast, how often a digital asset may be physically reproduced, what an 
asset may specifically not be used for, and liability limitations when using the 
asset are but a few of the rights and obligations expressible via a license.
        </p>
        
        <p>
The following example describes a very simple license for personal use.
        </p>
        <pre class="example prettyprint language-jsonld">
{
   "@context": "https://w3id.org/payswarm/v1",
   "@id": "http://payswarm.example.com/licenses/personal-use",
   "@type": "ps:License",
   "dc:format": "text/html",
   "ps:licenseTemplate": "This personal use license allows you to save the 
      purchased asset onto any device that you own for your personal enjoyment
      and make up to &lt;span property=\"ex:physicalCopies\" /&gt; printed
      copies of the work for personal use."
   "ps:licenseTerms": 
   {
      "ex:physicalCopies": 5
   }
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note">
<tref>License</tref>s do not need to be created for each site on the Web. In
many cases, common licenses can be placed on a website and re-used by a large
number of sites that sell assets under similar license terms.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Publishing a Listing</h3>

        <p>
A <tref>listing</tref> describes the combination of an <tref>asset</tref> 
that is for sale under a specific <tref>license</tref> and a set of payment 
terms that must be fulfilled in order to access the asset. Listings are often 
published on websites that sell assets via PaySwarm as a way to express things
that are for sale, in a decentralized manner.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes an <tref>asset</tref> for sale 
for $0.05 USD under a <tref>license</tref>
that covers acceptable use of blog posts. The offer is valid from March 2nd 
2011 to March 3rd 2011. The only restriction on additional payees is that the 
<tref>authority</tref> (the organization processing the payment) 
may only take a maximum of 10% of the final sale price to cover their fees.

        <h3>Performing a Purchase</h3>

        <p>
A normal purchase, as opposed to an automatic purchase, is typically performed
via a Web browser-based <tref>user agent</tref> when the <tref>participant</tref>
has never performed a purchase with the <tref>vendor</tref>'s website. The 
process consists of re-directing the Web browser to the buyer's PaySwarm
Authority for the purposes of authorizing payment to the vendor for a
particular <tref>listing</tref>. If a payment authorization is not approved,
the user agent is re-directed back to the vendor's website with an error.
If the payment authorization is approved, the user agent is re-directed back to
the vendor's website with a short-form <tref>contract</tref>, which 
is used as a proof-of-purchase for the vendor's listing.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Purchase Terms</h2>
          <p>
There are a number of terms that are used during the course of the purchase
process.
          <dl>
            <dt><tdef>listing hash</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
An identifier created by processing a <tref>listing</tref> expressed as
JSON-LD through the 
<a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/ED/20110911#normalization-1">JSON-LD 
Universal Graph Normalization Algorithm (UGNA2011)</a> and then generating a
SHA-1 hash of the result.
            </dd>
            <dt><tdef>purchase callback</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
An IRI that will be on the receiving end of an HTTP POST from the
<tref>authority</tref> with the result of a purchase request.
            </dd>
            <dt><tdef>reference identifier</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
A string value that MUST be greater than one character and less than 256
characters used by the <tref>vendor</tref> to track purchases. These 
identifiers can be used to ensure that <tref>asset</tref> that can be purchased 
multiple times, like game tokens, can be tracked by the vendor.
These identifiers also allow the vendor to protect against unintended
double-purchasing due to network failures.
            </dd>
            <dt><tdef>receipt</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
The resulting value of a purchase request, typically sent from the
<tref>authority</tref> to the <tref>publishing agent</tref>. The 
object typically contains a <tref>short-form contract</tref> as well as 
other information that may be pertinent to the transaction.

        <p>
The normative algorithm for performing a purchase is expressed below.

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
The <tref>publishing agent</tref> initiates a purchase request for a specific

              <li>
Generate the <tdef>purchase request IRI</tdef> by concatenating the
<tref>contracts service</tref> and the following IRI parameters:

                  <dt><code>listing</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The URL-encoded <tref>listing</tref> IRI.
                  </dd>
                  <dt><code>listing-hash</code></dt>
                  <dd>
A SHA-1 hash of the listing after being normalized using the

                  <dt><code>callback</code></dt>
                  <dd>
A de-referenceable IRI that MUST be able to process an HTTP POST request from

        <h3>Performing Automatic Purchases</h3>

        <p>
An automatic purchase is one where a <tref>vendor</tref> has been
previously authorized by a <tref>participant</tref> to perform purchases with
the buyer's pre-authorized consent. This is typically used when the 
<tref>vendor</tref> is trusted, or when the <tref>participant</tref> has set a 
spending limit with the <tref>vendor</tref> and does not want to be bothered
unless that spending limit is reached. Automatic purchases are designed to 
get out of the way of the <tref>participant</tref> and make the transactional flow
as friction-free as possible.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Purchase Terms</h2>
          <p>
There are a number of terms that are used during the course of the purchase
process.
          <dl>
            <dt><tdef>purchase request</tdef></dt>
            <dd>
A message consisting of a <tref>listing</tref> IRI, 
a <tref>listing hash</tref>, a <tref>participant</tref> identity IRI, and
an optional <tref>reference identifier</tref>. The message is typically sent
by a <tref>publishing agent</tref> to a <tref>participant</tref>'s 
<tref>authority</tref> for processing.

        <h3>The Automatic Purchase Algorithm</h3>
        
        <p>
The automatic purchase algorithm is outlined below:
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>

        <h3>The Contract</h3>

        <p>
A <tref>contract</tref> is the result of a commercial transaction in PaySwarm 
and contains information such as the <tref>listing</tref>, 
the <tref>asset</tref> that was purchased, the parties involved in the
transaction, the <tref>license</tref> outlining the rights to the 
asset, and payment information associated with the transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
The following example describes a purchase that occurred on March 2nd 2011
for a Web-based article called "PaySwarm in Practice". The article was authored
and listed for sale by Bob Smith and a personal use license was acquired by 
Jane, who may now peruse the article.

        <h2>The Decentralized Settlement Algorithm</h2>

        <p>
The following algorithm ensures that funds transferred as a part of a 
<tref>transaction</tref> can be transmitted to one or more 
<tref>authority</tref> payment processors in an interoperable 
fashion such that there are no dangers that the value exchange is lost or
mis-applied to the wrong accounts.
        </p>
        
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
The <tref>disbursing authority</tref> contacts each 
<tref>receiving authority</tref> listed in the list of <tref>transfer</tref>s
contained in the <tref>transaction</tref> being processed and retrieves the
<code>ps:TransactionBackhaul</code> service from each 
<tref>configuration service</tref> endpoint. If any
<tref>receiving authority</tref> is not available now or at any point during
this process, or if the <tref>receiving authority</tref> is blacklisted for
any reason, the <tref>transaction</tref> MUST fail.
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>disbursing authority</tref> processes <tref>transfer</tref>s
intended for <tref>financial account</tref>s that are local to the system,

          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>disbursing authority</tref> processes <tref>transfer</tref>s
intended for <tref>financial account</tref>s that are on

          <li>
The <tref>disbursing authority</tref> transmits the <tref>transaction</tref>
to each <tref>receiving authority</tref>. The <tref>receiving authority</tref>
processes <tref>transfer</tref>s intended for 
<tref>financial account</tref>s that are on the
<tref>receiving authority</tref> noting incoming 
<tref>transfer</tref> amounts in each target
<tref>financial account</tref>'s <tref>escrow transfer log</tref>. If all
amounts were not successfully marked in escrow, the <tref>transaction</tref>
MUST fail.
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>disbursing authority</tref> moves all funds from escrow into all
local <tref>financial account</tref>s. The <tref>disbursing authority</tref>
contacts all <tref title="receiving authority">receiving authorities</tref> and
instructs them to move all funds from escrow into all destination
<tref>financial account</tref>s. This two-stage commit process ensures that
in the event of a failure while contacting multiple 
<tref title="receiving authority">receiving authorities</tref>, that 
transactions can be backed out.
            <div class="note">
While this algorithm outlines how transfer records are transmitted and
recorded in a decentralized fashion, it does not outline how each 
<tref>authority</tref> ensures that currencies are exchanged between
financial institutions. One such possibility is an ACH banking transfer, but
such a transfer is not necessary if the banks adopt this protocol for clearing
transactions across financial systems.

      <h2>Data Portability</h2>
      <p>
One of the freedoms that is ensured by this specification is the freedom to
own your data and move it to an <tref>authority</tref> of your choosing. 
That is, your transaction history is your property and therefore you must be 
able to move it to a location of your choosing at will. In order to ensure 
that this freedom is protected, data portability MUST be implemented by 
all conforming implementations of this specification.

        <h3>Authority Migration</h3>

        <p>
In order to ensure data portability from one <tref>authority</tref> to 
another <tref>authority</tref>, the following objects MUST be transferred:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>All <tref title="identity">identities</tref></li>
          <li>All <tref>public key</tref>s</li>

          <li>All <tref>transaction</tref>s</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Once the transfer is complete, the new <tref>authority</tref> MUST provide the
old <tref>authority</tref> with new IRIs for each <tref>public key</tref>, 
<tref>identity</tref> and <tref>financial account</tref>. The old 
<tref>authority</tref> MUST setup HTTP 301 redirects from the
old IRIs to the new IRIs. Any transaction migrated from the
old <tref>authority</tref> to the new <tref>authority</tref> MUST be honored
and any request to purchase the item again MUST NOT result in a debit to any
<tref>financial account</tref>.

A <tdef>transaction intent</tdef> is the agreement to execute a

        <h2>The Transaction Intent Algorithm</h2>

        <p>
The following algorithm describes the <tref>transaction intent</tref> process,
which consists of three distinct phases. The first phase is the publication of
the parameterized <tref>listing</tref> by the <tref>promisor</tref>. The 
second phase is the submission of transaction intents from 
<tref>promisee</tref>s. The third phase is the finalization of transaction 
intents into <tref>contract</tref>s.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
This section still needs a ton of work: specify the JSON-LD messages that are 
transmitted in detail, examples, and cover error conditions and
exceptions.
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
The <tref>promisor</tref> creates an <tref>asset</tref> describing the asset
provided if the parameters in the parameterized <tref>listing</tref> are met.
The <tref>promisor</tref> also creates a parameterized <tref>listing</tref>
containing at least the following two fields:
            <dl>
              <dt><code>ps:constraint</code></dt>
              <dd>
A set of parameters that must be met in order to complete the 
<tref>transaction</tref>.
                <dl>
                  <dt><code>com:minimumAmount</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The minimum amount necessary, in aggregate, to finalize all transaction intents
before the deadline.
                  </dd>
                  <dt><code>com:currency</code></dt>
                  <dd>
The currency associated with the minimum amount field.
                  </dd>
                </dl>
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </li>
          <li>
When an <tref>authority</tref> processes the parameterized <tref>listing</tref>,
per <a href="#the-purchase-algorithm">The Purchase Algorithm</a>, a 
<code>ps:Contract</code> and <code>ps:Receipt</code> are generated as 
specified in the algorithm, but funds MUST NOT be disbursed at that time. 
Instead of the <code>ps:Receipt</code>'s <code>ps:contract</code>'s property 
being of <code>@type</code> <code>ps:Contract</code>, it MUST instead be of type 
<code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>. All other fields must remain the same both
in the short-form contract and the long-form contract. 
The <tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>publishing agent</tref> is notified of the
intent in the same way as it would be notified of a purchase except that the
resulting receipt will be the modified object as described in this step.
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>promisee</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> then notifies the 
<tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> of the transaction intent by
retrieving the <tref>transaction service</tref> IRI from the 
<tref>configuration service</tref>. The <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code> is
sent to the <tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> via an HTTPS POST.
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> keeps track of all
<code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>'s for the parameterized <tref>listing</tref>
until the end of the <code>ps:validUntil</code> date in the 
<tref>listing</tref> or until the <code>com:minimumAmount</code> in the
<code>ps:constraint</code> property in the <tref>listing</tref> has been met 
in aggregate.
          </li>
          <li>
If the <tref>authority</tref> detects that the <code>com:minimumAmount</code> 
in the <code>ps:constraint</code> property in the <tref>listing</tref> 
has been met in aggregate, it submits all <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>s 
for the parameterized <tref>listing</tref> to each <tref>promisee</tref>'s
<tref>authority</tref>. That is, for every <code>com:source</code> 
<tref>financial account</tref> intended to transfer money to the 
<code>com:destination</code> in each <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>s, the
source <tref>financial account</tref>s <tref>authority</tref> is contacted.
          </li>
          <li>
The <tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> MUST determine if all
<tref>promisee</tref>'s can meet their obligation. It does 
so by contacting each <tref>promisee</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> and
performing an HTTP POST of all <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>s intended
for the <tref>authority</tref> to the <tref>transaction service</tref> with
an additional query parameter where the key is <code>mode</code> and the
value is <code>query</code>. Each <tref>promisee</tref>'s 
<tref>authority</tref> responds with a total amount of funds that are available
to be committed.
          </li>
          <li>
If the previous step is successful and there are enough funds to meet the
<tref>com:minimumAmount</tref> constraint, then the 
<tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> MUST then place all amounts
listed in all <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code> on hold. It does 
this by contacting each <tref>promisee</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> by
performing an HTTP POST of all <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>'s intended
for the <tref>authority</tref> to the <tref>transaction service</tref> with
an additional query parameter where the key is <code>mode</code> and the
value is <code>hold</code>. Each <tref>promisee</tref>'s 
<tref>authority</tref> responds with a total amount of funds placed on hold. 
          </li>
          <li>
If the previous step is successful and enough funds were placed on hold
to meet the <tref>com:minimumAmount</tref> constraint, then the 
<tref>promisor</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> MUST then retrieve all amounts
listed in all <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>s. It does 
this by contacting each <tref>promisee</tref>'s <tref>authority</tref> by
performing an HTTP POST of all <code>ps:TransactionIntent</code>'s intended
for the <tref>authority</tref> to the <tref>transaction service</tref> with
an additional query parameter where the key is <code>mode</code> and the
