An <em>identity</em> is a Linked Data description of a particular entity 
such as a person or organization. This specification describes a mechanism of 
reading and writing to an online Linked Data identity. Linked Data identities
are useful for storing arbitrary information, such as a person's shipping
address, passport information, or age. The data is only accessible 
by authorized applications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'> 
      <p>
This is a highly experimental specification that is attempting to unify the
work performed in the the Web Payments Community Group, 
the Linked Data community, the WebID Community Group, 
and the Mozilla Persona team. As such, the specification borrows a number of
concepts from each group and attempts to sythesize these concepts into a
solution that would be easily implemented and deployed by Web developers in
order to provide an elegant readable and writable identity mechanism for the
Web.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
An <tref>identity</tref> is a set of information that can be used to 
identify a particular entity such as a person, animal, or organization. We 
use identities to access many services throughout our lives. For example,
we use email addresses to identify ourselves to online services, 
driver's licenses to prove that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle,
and government issued passports to travel between countries. It is the goal
of this specification to provide an easy way of expressing all of this
identity information on the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
There are a number of design principles that have gone into the creation of
this specification. The following is a brief list of these requirements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
It must be decentralized.
        </li>
        <li>
It must support discoverability by using a resolvable address, like a URL 
or email address.
        </li>
        <li>
It must support, with authorization, arbitrary machine-readable information 
being attached to the identity by 3rd parties.
        </li>
        <li>
It must be able to provide both public and private data to external sites, 
based on who is accessing the resource.
        </li>
        <li>
It must provide a secure digital signature and encryption mechanism.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
This specification enables secure, decentralized, discoverable, controlled 
access to arbitrary machine-readable information associated with an identity.
Since each identity has a varying degree of personal information associated 
with it, the specification ensures that a single entity can associate themselves 
with multiple identities. For example, one may want to use one identity to 
access  banking services while another identity could be used to play 
online games.
      </p>
      <p>
In order to store the breadth of information that is typically associated with
an identity, a simple but extensible data model is utilized. 
The specification uses a data storage and expression approach called
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. it
is a way of expressing information on the Web that is both simple and
extensible. Specifically, the Linked Data technology used by this specification 
is JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]].
      </p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><tdef>identity</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
A set of information that can be used to identify a particular entity such as 
a person, animal, or organization. An entity may have multiple identities

        <dt><tdef>assertion</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
A verifiable statement by an entity. The assertion is directed at a
particular <tref>identity</tref> via an <tref>identifier URL</tref>.

        <dt><tdef>requestor</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
An entity that is requesting to access and/or modify an <tref>identity</tref>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Identity</h2>
      <p>
An entity may have one or more identities associated with it. These can be
anonymous identities, pseudo-anonymous identities, protected identities, 
and public identities. The creation of these identities is out of scope
for this document, but typically result in the creation of a long-lived
identity URL. For example, <code>https://example.com/identities/john</code> is
an example of a long-lived identity URL.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>A Basic Identity</h2>
        <p>
A basic identity contains at least the type information for the identity.
        <dl>
        <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
        <dd>The value <code>https://w3id.org/identity/v1</code>, or an equivalent
JSON-LD Context [[!JSON-LD]] expressing the terminology necessary for the 
expression of the data.</dd>
        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>The value <code>Identity</code>.</dd>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A Typical Identity</h2>
        <p>
A typical identity will have a mix of public and private data associated with
it. For example:
        </p>
        
<pre class="example" title="A typical identity containing address and citizenship information">{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.com/identities/bob",
  "type": "Identity",
  "name": "Bob Bobman",
  "governmentId": "123-45-6789",
  "birthdate": "1985-12-14",
  "email": "bbob@example.com",
  "mobileNumber": "12345678910",
  "shippingAddress": {
    "street": "372 Sumter Lane",
    "city": "Blackrock",
    "region": "Nevada",
    "postalCode": "237842"
  },
  "assertion": [{
    "id": "http://ssa.us.gov/assertions/3732",
    "type": "PassportAssertion",
    "endorsement": {
      "id": "https://example.com/identities/bob",
      "name": "Bob Bobman",
      "birthdate": "1985-12-14",
      "governmentId": "123-45-6789"
    },
    "expires": "2018-01-01",
    "signature": {
       "type": "GraphSignature2012",
       "signer": "https://ssa.us.gov/keys/27",
       "signature": "3780eyfh3q0fhhfiq3q9f8ahsidfhf29rhaish"
    }
  }, ... ]
}</pre>
       <p>
The example above contains a mix of public and private information. For example,
the <tref>identity owner</tref> may be comfortable with making their 
<code>name</code> publicly readable and would do so using the 
<tref title="identity provider">identity provider's</tref> website interface.
Other information, such as <code>governmentId</code> and <code>email</code>
would be marked as private, and would only be shared after the request for
that particular information has been approved by the 
<tref>identity owner</tref>.
       </p>
       <p>
Information can be <tref title="assertion">asserted</tref> by a trusted
third party and written to the identity using the mechanism described in
<a href="#writing-data-to-the-identity">Section 4: Writing Data to
the Identity</a>. Not all information needs to be verifiably 
<tref title="assertion">asserted</tref>. For example, 
<code>shippingAddress</code> above is not asserted and is thus unverifiable. A
<tref>requestor</tref> would just have to trust that the 
<code>shippingAddress</code> information provided
by the <tref>identity owner</tref> is trustworthy. Other information, such as
<code>name</code>, <code>birthdate</code>, and <code>governmentId</code> 
have been <tref title="assertion">asserted</tref> in a verifiable way by a
3rd party. In this particular case, the information has been asserted by
the Social Security Administration of the United States government.
       </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Accessing the Identity</h1>
      <p>
There are two mechanisms that allow a 3rd party to read protected information
from an identity. The first is an
HTTP Signature [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] based mechanism that allows any authorized
client to access data that has been pre-approved by the entity that controls
access to the identity information. The second is to use a browser-based 
mechanism that POSTs a request to an identity, allowing the identity owner to 
interactively decide what data access to allow or disallow.
      </p>

      <p>
The table below summarizes the HTTP Signatures-based [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] 
mechanism of accessing and modifying an identity:
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th style="white-space: nowrap;">HTTP Method</th>
            <th>Description of Action</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>
Read all of the information that is available to the <tref>requestor</tref>. 
Note: This may only be a subset of all of the information based on the level 
of access the <tref>requestor</tref> has to certain attributes in the resource.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>POST</td>
            <td>
Used to perform operations on the identity for applications that are not
capable of using HTTP Signatures [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] or to perform specific
queries on the identity data.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PATCH</td>
            <td>
Modify information in the identity using the JSON Patch [[!JSON-PATCH]] 
protocol.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PUT</td>
            <td>
Replace the entire identity with the provided identity document. This operation 
SHOULD only be accessible to the owner of the identity.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td>
            <td>
Deletes the identity. This operation SHOULD only be accessible to the owner of 
the identity.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="issue">
It's questionable whether we would want a PUT or DELETE mechanism at all.
      </p>

      <p>
Not every Web application is capable of pre-arranging access to an identity,
performing HTTP Signatures [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]], or executing 
HTTP PATCH requests. In these cases, a regular HTTP POST mechanism is provided
for Web applications to read, write, and query information about the identity.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th style="white-space: nowrap;">POST Parameter</th>
            <th>Description of Action</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>action=query</td>
            <td>
Performs a query on the identity given a JSON-LD Frame in the POST body.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>action=patch</td>
            <td>
Modify information in the identity using the JSON Patch [[!JSON-PATCH]] protocol.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <section>
        <h2>Reading Identity Information</h2>
        <p>
Reading identity information can be performed in 3 different ways depending on
the sensitivity of the information being accessed. An 
<tref>identity provider</tref> SHOULD
ensure that sensitive information is always transmitted and received over a
secure channel, such as TLS [[!TLS]].
        </p>
        <p>
An identity can be accessed using a regular HTTP GET on the identity URL:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An attempt to read all identity information without authentication">
GET /identities/alice HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2013 20:51:35 GMT
        </pre>
        <p>
If the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP Header is not specified, a response using
the <code>application/ld+json</code> content type must be provided. Other
content types MAY be negotiated for between the client and server. The
<code>application/ld+json</code> content type is the only content type that
MUST be supported for all requests in this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
The result of the GET request SHOULD be information deemed to be public by the
<tref>identity owner</tref>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An example result when reading identity information without authentication">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice",
  "type": "Identity",
  "name": "Alice Smith"
  "publicKey": [{ "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice/keys/1" }]
}
        </pre>
        <p>
As the response above shows, the only information that the 
<tref>identity owner</tref> has specified as being public is their
<code>name</code> and a reference to their <code>publicKey</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
In order to access identity information that is not public, the request SHOULD
be authenticated and authorized against a known identity. The HTTP Signatures
[[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] specification is used to digitally sign the request:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An attempt to read all identity information with HTTP Signature-based authentication">
GET /identities/alice HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2013 20:52:12 GMT
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Authorization: Signature 
  keyId="http://example.org/identities/bob/keys/4",
  algorithm="rsa-sha256",
  headers="(request-line) host date content-type",
  signature="Gm7W/r+e90REDpWyt.../VebAsNUtvQMe6cTjnDY="
        </pre>
<p>
The result of the GET request will now include information that the
<tref>requestor</tref> has been pre-authorized to read by the
<tref>identity owner</tref>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An example result when reading identity information with authentication">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice",
  "type": "Identity",
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "asmith@example.com",
  "mobileNumber": "4424672637162",
  "publicKey": [{ "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice/keys/1" }]
}
        </pre>
        <p>
As the response above shows, in addition to the public information, the
<tref>identity owner</tref> has authorized the <tref>requestor</tref> to
access their <code>email</code> and <code>mobileNumber</code> as well.
        </p>
        <p>
In the event that the <tref>requestor</tref> has not authorized itself prior
to the request, or if it is not capable of performing an HTTP Signature
[[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]], it may utilize a POST-and-callback-based approach, as
demonstrated below:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="A request to read citizenship information from an identity">
POST /identities/alice?action=query&assertions=true&callback=https://flights.example.org/verify?session=7f8nddn HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2013 20:52:12 GMT
Content-Type: application/ld+json

{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice",
  "name": ""
  "governmentId": ""
  "birthdate": ""
}</pre>
        <p>
The result of the POST request will be a dialog that the 
<tref>identity provider</tref> displays to the <tref>identity owner</tref>
asking them to verify the information that will be transmitted to the
<tref>requestor</tref>. The mechanism used to present this dialog to the
<tref>identity owner</tref> is outside of the scope of this specification.
The result of a successful interaction with the verification dialog will be 
a POST back to the callback URL provided by the <tref>requestor</tref>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="A successful response to an interactive request for citizenship information from an identity">

    }
  }]
}
        </pre>
        <p>
As the response above shows, the <tref>identity owner</tref> accepted the
request for information and the <tref>identity provider</tref> has performed
a POST to the callback URL provided by the <tref>requestor</tref> via the
<tref>identity owner</tref>'s web browser. Since the request included the
<code>assertions=true</code> flag, the assertions for the information requested
have been included so that the <tref>requestor</tref> may validate the 
information against the 3rd party assertions.
        </p>
     </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Writing Data to the Identity</h2>
        <p>
JSON-LD data in the body of the request is written to the identity by 
performing an HTTP POST call with a query
parameter called <code>action</code> appended to the identity URL with a value
matching one of the possibilities below:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><code>query</code></dt>
          <dd>
Performs a query on the identity given a JSON-LD Frame in the POST body.
          </dd>
          <dt><code>patch</code></dt>

        <h2>Access Control via HTTP Signatures</h2>
        <p>
There are two mechanisms that allow a 3rd party to read protected information
from an identity. The first is to use a browser-based mechanism that
POSTs a request to an identity, allowing the identity owner to 
interactively decide what data access to allow or disallow. The second is an
HTTP Signature [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] based mechanism that allows any authorized
client to access data that has been pre-approved by the entity that controls
access to the identity information.

        <h2>Claims and Endorsements</h2>
        <p>
It is possible for a 3rd party to provide digitally signed assertions to be
stored with an identity. For example, if an individual would like to store
digitally signed credentials verifiying their citizenship information, they
would go through the following process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to a government website and start the verification process.</li>
          <li>Provide their identity URL to the government website.</li>
          <li>The government website would digitally sign a claim and attempt to write it to the provided identity.</li>
          <li>The individual would be provided with a dialog to authorize the write of the information to their identity.</li>
          <li>If the authorization is successful, the digitally signed information is written to the identity and will be returned in future queries for such an endorsement.</li>
        <ol>

      <h1>Compatability with other Identity Mechanisms</h1>
      <p>
This identity mechanism is designed to be compatible with other identity
mechanisms in use today such as OpenID, Facebook Connect, and Firefox ID.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Integration with Mozilla Persona / Firefox ID</h2>
        <p>
The identity mechanism is such that it can be returned in a 
Mozilla Persona or FxID-based login. The assertion returned to the FxID-enabled
website would contain an identity URL which would be compatible with this
specification. This allows both the basic email address to the validated, and
extension information (such as citizenship information, age assertions) to be
discoverable after the login.

        <h2>Integration with OpenID, OAuth1, and OAuth2</h2>
        <p class="issue">
The mechanism should be able to be used via OpenID, OpenID Connect, and possibly
both versions of OAuth. This section should elaborate how one can provide
pointers to the identity assertion URL using those methods.
