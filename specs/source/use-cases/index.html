The primary goal of the Web Payments work at the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) is to create a safe, decentralized system and a set of
open, patent and royalty-free specifications that allow people on the
Web to send each other money as easily as they exchange instant messages
and e-mail today. The following use cases focus on transforming the way we 
reward each other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.
      </p> 
    </section> 
    <section> 
      <h2>Introduction</h2> 
      <p>
The Web continues to transform the way humankind communicates and builds
our world. At the heart of most of these endeavors is the exchange of
value. Gifts, attention, and payments each play a role in the ecosystem
that we call the economy. Until now, there has been no open and
universal way of sending and receiving payments on the Web through your
browser. This is why people are still compelled to reach for their
credit card or log into a payment site when purchasing something over
the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
There are a number non-interoperable payment solutions today. This
document outlines use cases that are supported by existing payment
solutions today, and also outlines innovative use cases that could be
supported in the future by a universal payment mechanism to enable next
generation mobile payments, alternative currencies, crowd-sourced
investing, next-generation banking, and electronic commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification outlines use cases that are enabled by universal
payment for the Web. The goal of addressing the use cases as a whole is
to create a safe, decentralized system and a set of open, patent and
royalty-free specifications that allow people on the Web to send each
other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and e-mail
today. Addressing these scenarios will transform the way we reward each
other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.

      <h2>Web Payments 1.0 Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
The following use cases outline scenarios that are targeted to be supported
in the set of Web Payments 1.0 specifications.
      </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Simple Payment Links</h2> 
   
      <p>
  Lars wants to collect $100 from his friends to throw a joint party, he would
  like to send a simple link out to his friends that would work with whoever their
  favorite payment provider is at the time.
      </p>

      <section> 
        <h3>Requirements</h3> 
   
        <ul> 
          <li>
  Identity and financial account identifiers MUST be standardized, discoverable
  and unique. Dereferenceable IRIs may be the best mechanism to accomplish
  the previous three requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
  Simple IRIs MUST be supported that can be used across the Web, and when
  clicked upon, auto-complete payment information to the recipient on the senders
  favorite payment software/provider.
          </li> 
        </ul>

      <h2>Independent Distribution and Pricing</h2>
 
<p>Jude blogs about music and movies and has achieved a respectable
following of people that read his blog. He would like to sell content that
he writes about to his many readers, but doesn't have the music and movie
industry connections to acquire content for distribution. Typically,
content deals require a multi-million dollar, advance payment in return
for the right to sell content. This high up-front cost removes many
potential sellers, harming the overall incentive to distribute for people
that run smaller music websites and blogs.</p> 

<p>There are many existing clearing houses for content on the web today. If
those clearing houses were able to manage artist content, content creators
could use the clearing house to setup the distribution rights for their
content. Smaller content distributors, like Jude, could then offer content
to their site visitors without worrying about the high-cost or management
overhead associated with managing content catalogs.</p> 
    
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
The asset provider (blogger) MAY be a separate entity from
asset owner (musician/label/production company).
        </li> 
     
        <li>
The asset provider MUST be able to distribute content without
the asset owner direct permission as long as the asset license and
royalty payments set by the asset creator is respected.</li> 
     
        <li>
The asset provider MUST be able to set distribution prices independently 
of the asset owner.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
The asset owner MUST be able to set base royalties independently of
the asset provider and those base royalties MUST be enforced by the transaction
authority.
        </li> 
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Decentralized, Machine-readable Metadata</h2> 
 
<p>Lars would like to ensure that the purchase process for a digital good
is streamlined as much as possible into the web browser that he has
created. When somebody uses the web browser, he would like to display a
"Buy" button in the address bar. The media details such as the title of the
work, the price and the details required to perform a swarming purchase
would be lifted from the web page.</p> 

<p>The purchase process would be as simple as the buyer clicking the Buy
button and watching a download progress dialog appear on the screen.
Account and payment details could be stored in the web browser to ease the
purchase process. Not bothering the person browsing for payment details
would be especially useful in scenarios where very small payments were
needed to access content.</p> 
 
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 

      <ul> 
        <li>
Asset details SHOULD be expressed in a Web page such that a Web User-Agent can 
extract the details of a piece of digital content.
        </li> 

        <li>
All relevant payment details SHOULD be expressed in a Web page such
that a Web User-Agent may purchase content after detecting the payment
processing details on a page.
        </li> 
        <li>
All assets and listings for sale MUST be able to be listed in an ad-hoc manner.
There must not be a centralized asset or listing service of any kind.
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </section>
  </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Separation of Content from Licenses</h2> 

<p>The Association of Science Journalists Conference would like to present
a series of live keynotes by luminaries in their respective fields. The
presentations would be open to conference attendees or those that pay for a
virtual day pass for the conference. The license could be purchased
separately and then could be used to access a number of download sources. 
Remote access to journalists would be granted at a different payment rate 
than non-members.</p>

<p>It is important that a separation is made between the content license
and the download contract. The content license specifies usage and access
rights. The download contract specifies the download negotiables, such as
payment rate, speed and other details associated with the data stream. By
separating the two concerns, we can allow network specialization to occur
between those that would grant licenses for digital content and those that
would deliver digital content. Ensuring that both could operate
semi-autonomously would allow semi-independent optimization of market
variables.</p> 
  
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
The system MUST be able to distinguish between licenses and contracts
for data delivery.
        </li>
        
        <li>
One SHOULD be able to purchase the license and then have the option of 
choosing their download source separately. Content licenses and
data delivery contracts SHOULD be able to be negotiated separately.
        </li>

        <li>
Licenses MAY be used to get access to data streams on 3rd party provider
sites. Payment for licenses and payment for data SHOULD be separate concerns.
        </li> 
     
      </ul>

    <h2>Micropayments to Thousands of Individuals</h2> 

<p>Penelope has completed her fourth book of photography. She would like to
charge a very small amount for her travel expenses and supplies but doesn't
want to make a living from the sale of her book. Penelope does, however,
want to make a number of contributions to charities that she would like to
support as well as give her fans the ability to contribute to their
favorite charities.</p> 

<p>Giving individuals on the network the ability to add optional payees to
licenses and contracts would enable payment models such as online tipping
for artists, donations to charity, and batched payments to a particular
initiative or cause to be made along-side the purchase.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Network participants MUST be allowed to add arbitrary accounts as
payees for transactions if allowed by the original content owner.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
A large number of payee accounts MUST be allowed to be batched with
content transactions. Lists of payees SHOULD be allowable up in the
thousands of payees.</li> 
      </ul>

    <h2>Re-Sale Permissions</h2> 
 
    <p>
Quincy, a medical researcher in the USA, produces a PDF report about the
side-effects of a new prescription drug. He wants to sell access to the
full article from his website, but with a "no resale" limitation.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Assets MUST be allowed to be only re-sold by the original creator of that
asset through some set of "resale permissions" that are expressed in the
asset listing.
        </li> 
      </ul>
    </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Recurring Payments</h2> 
 
    <p>
A game programmer creates a new multi-player game for online and/or 
offline use. He would like to list the game for sale online noting him as
the game creator. He also believes in player generated content, so would
like to allow content modification. However, if the game is modified, it
can no longer be commercialized. He would like to
collect payment for online use by subscription (monthly, yearly); or collect
a single payment for the downloaded version of the game. He also wants to
allow downstream commercializing for the unmodified, downloaded version only.
The downloaded version profit should be limited to 30% of gross sales 
receipts paid to original author, as well as 10% of site advertising revenue 
(if any) from the downstream page selling the game.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Subscription-based payments MUST be supported.
        </li> 

        <li>
Ad-hoc, recurring payments MUST be supported.
        </li> 

        <li>
Complex rules MUST be allowed in the license. The rules MAY be machine-readable.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Mobile Computing-based Purchase</h2> 
 
    <p>
Boris picks out a few items at a street vendor stand and wants to check out
using his mobile device. The vendor tallys up all of the items that Boris 
wants and points Boris at a nearby NFC reader. Boris waves his phone in front
of the NFC reader, views the amount and clicks the Pay button. The vendor is
notified and gives Boris his items.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3>

      <ul> 
        <li>
A mobile device MUST be able to read a purchase suggestion from a non-Web
based location containing all of the details of the purchase.
        </li> 

        <li>
A purchase MUST be performed on an asset that does not exist on the Web, but
for which all of the information describing the asset is communicated during
the purchase suggestion.
        </li> 

        <li>
A purchase response MUST be allowed to be sent back to the vendor via a
non-Web communication channel.

  <section> 
    <h2>Point-of-Sale Device</h2> 
 
    <p>
Yavin owns a mobile food truck and allows his patrons to pay via any card with
a magnetic stripe on it. Yavin uses the alternate payment network because it 
charges lower per-transaction fees than the major payment network that most of 
the surrounding businesses use. He accepts payments via a magnetic stripe 
card reader that is attached to his cellphone. Each card swiped is tied to 
a payment account, which is charged directly and he sees the result of the
transaction on his mobile phone. This allows people to continue using their
existing magnetic stripe cards, but allows Yavin to process transactions over
alternate payment networks.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Point-of-Sale devices MUST be able to initiate automatic transfers given an
access PIN that is tied to a particular payment site and customer account.
        </li> 
      </ul>

  <section> 
    <h2>Automated Vending</h2> 
 
    <p>
It is a hot day and Larson is thirsty. He spots a nearby refrigerated vending
machine that is selling cold lemonade. He notices that the vending machine,
while having no Internet connection to the outside world, allows him to
use his mobile device to make a purchase using Web Payments. He clicks the button,
his phone activates and asks him if he wants to make the purchase, he clicks
yes and the lemonade drops into the receiving bucket.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
A device MUST be able to route purchases through customer devices and receive
a purchase receipt from the customer device.
        </li> 

        <li>
A device MUST be able to verify a purchase receipt counter-signed by a trusted
source other than the payment authority.

    <h2>Currency Exchange</h2> 
 
    <p>
Olaf would like to exchange 50 Euro into US Dollars through a simple online
money exchange service. He would like his payment authority to be the
initiator of the exchange and the final destination of the exchange to be a
newly created account for US Dollars.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
There MUST be a mechanism to translate one currency into another currency.
        </li> 

        <li>
There MAY be a mechanism where one specifies a mint to create new units of
currency and transfer those units into a payment authority.
        </li> 
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>


  <section> 
    <h2>Alternative Currencies</h2> 
 
    <p>
Rigo would like to create a local currency for his town, which is fairly poor
but contains a moderate population that volunteers their time at a number of
community-supported farms in the area. He would like to reward the area
citizens with time-banked credits that can be redeemed for food or other
services at local businesses and restaurants.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Alternative currencies MUST be supported.
        </li>
        <li>
Alternative currencies MUST be allowed to be created dynamically in the system.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

  <section> 
    <h2>Streaming Payments</h2> 
 
<p>Tellulah is a DJ and would like to setup a non-profit Internet radio
station to stream Weekly Top 40 songs along with a mix of independent
music. She would like to cover her expenses as well as the standard
per-song ephemeral broadcasting fee set by the US Copyright Arbitration
Panel to ensure she is legally compliant at all times. Registering and
tracking royalties can be a very daunting and time consuming process. A
mechanism that reduces the burden of legal compliance could drive more
stations to come online.</p> 

<p>Online radio broadcasters are also presently limited in their ability to
grow their stations due to the ephemeral broadcasting royalties that must
be paid on a per person/per song basis. Running these stations make it
difficult to collect, track and distribute royalties in a way that makes it
easy to integrate into the web browser. Often, donating or signing up to a
single download provider can be more trouble than it is worth. If there was
a universal mechanism to pay very small amounts for data streams on the
Web, new legal avenues for distributing content legally would be
enabled.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Payment MUST be able to be associated with a section of a stream of
data. Payment SHOULD be allowed to be associated with a particular number
of bytes or temporal time frame.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
Small fractions of whole currency amounts SHOULD be allowed in order
to ensure accurate metering and payment recouping for content streams.
        </li> 
      </ul>

  <section> 
    <h2>Crowd-funding</h2> 
 
    <p>
Dione would like to raise $10,000 to design and build a solar powered,
personal ground water pump and purifier for developing nations. He intends to
publish all of the plans on the Web as open hardware and start taking orders
from NGOs to install these pump-purifiers in villages around the world. Rather
than go through the process of writing a grant and waiting up to a year to
start on the work, he believes that he can raise the money faster through 
the Web and start the project within 3 months. 
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Intent-based deposit contracts MUST be supported, which can be redeemed by the 
payee in one bulk transfer. The entity raising the funds should be able to 
hold on to deposit contracts for a number months and "cash them in" when a
certain threshold has been reached.

    <h2>Proof-of-Purchase and Verifiable Digital Receipts</h2>

<p>Luciano has purchased a song from an online music store. The band that 
created the song would like to give people that purchased any song from their
last album the chance to view their latest music videos and behind-the-scenes
footage.</p>

<p>Since Luciano's browser was used to make the purchase, it has stored a
digitally signed receipt of the sale. When he visits the band's website, it 
asks his browser for a receipt that proves that he has purchased a song from 
their latest album. The digital receipt is sent to the website, is verified, 
and Luciano is allowed into the special VIP section of the band's website.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
The system MUST be able to express a digital receipt of sale or license 
that can be verified by a 3rd party.
        </li>
        <li>
The system MUST define a straight-forward mechanism for websites
to request digital receipts of sale.
        </li>
        <li>
The system MAY define a mechanism for web browsers to transmit a proper 
receipt or license based upon information on a page, but after 
transmission of the receipt has been authorized by the person or entity in
posession of the receipt.

    <h2>Conditional Redistribution</h2> 
 
    <p>
Rosa wants to publish a complete novel in multiple text formats.
When selling the novel, she wants to specify authorship as pseudonym; 
no content modification; and payment per download. She would like
downstream commercializing to be allowed, but with the following
constraints; no advertising (direct sale only); payment of 20% of gross 
per copy re-sold; any additional commercial rights for other media must 
obtain agreement of the original author.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Redistribution rules MUST allow the following conditions; limiting the
down-stream profit and limiting advertising.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Future Use Cases</h2>
      <p>
The following use cases were identified as important use cases, but have been
postponed until implementation lessons have been learned from the base 
Web Payments specifications.
      </p>

  <section> 
    <h2>Crowd-Sourcing Digital Distribution</h2> 
 
<p>Jane, who is an independent film maker, has just finished her
documentary and wishes to distribute it to a very large audience. She does
not have the resources to provide High-Definition streaming of her content
to her fans. She would also like to charge enough for the current
documentary in order to cover the production costs of the next documentary.
She could use BitTorrent to distribute her work, but it lacks the ability
to collect payment on her behalf. She would like to give some of the
proceeds of each sale to those that will help her distribute her
documentary.</p> 

<p>Ideally, Jane would register her work with a content clearinghouse. That
clearinghouse would provide the reference file which would be used to seed
the network. Once enough downloads have been performed, others on the
network could distribute the file in exchange for monetary compensation for
providing a download source.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
The system MUST be able to swarm file downloads from multiple sources.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
Payment MUST be able to be divvied out among thousands of download sources.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
Payment MUST be allowed to be made to arbitrary accounts on the network.
        </li>

    <h2>Ad-Based Content Payment</h2> 
 
<p>Joss directs and produces a number of excellent television shows. Over
the years, he has garnered a strong online following but doesn't have the
required numbers for a long television production run. He would like to
distribute his shows via the Web. Joss would like to partner with an
advertising network to provide audio and video advertisements to cover the
costs related to the production and distribution of his shows. In order to
do this, the system that he uses must be able to credit and debit payment
accounts accordingly whenever advertising is inserted into the content
stream.</p> 

<p>When a fan watches each episode, they can opt to pay for the episode in
full, pay for reduced advertisements, or request that advertisers cover the
entire cost of the show. Advertisers can choose to provide small payments
for anonymous advertisements, or larger payments if customers provide
advertising details and preferences to the advertisers.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Network participants SHOULD be allowed to credit other accounts on
the network. For example, asset acquirers should be allowed to ask other network
participants (advertisers) to partially cover their costs in exchange
for the insertion of ads into the data stream.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
Buyers SHOULD have the option of purchasing goods without advertising.

    <h2>Negotiation</h2> 
 
<p>Gregor runs a fairly active high-definition movie download site. His
data transmission prices are high during peak hours and low during off-peak
hours. He would like to give his customers the option to negotiate for
lower download prices if they download their movies during the off-peak
times. He would also like to reserve the right to refuse a contract
re-negotiation attempt if he has not made a pre-set sales quota and even
raise his prices if it would make sense for his business.</p> 

<p>The ability to change prices based on market demand would enable a more
dynamic marketplace, leading to more competition between download
providers. Giving buyers the ability to re-negotiate terms of sale would
not only give them a sense of empowerment, but could eliminate bad pricing
behavior on the network, leading to overall market efficiencies.</p> 

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
The system SHOULD allow asset acquirers and asset providers to negotiate 
the data download prices associated with a particular download.
        </li> 
     
        <li>
The system SHOULD allow buyers to negotiate the license details as
well as the license price with a particular asset owner.

    <h2>Live Pricing Algorithms</h2> 
 
    <p>
Aiyana, a folk-musician in Siberia, records local throat-singing music. She
would like to distribute the work via her website. She specifies 
authorship but does not want anyone to modify the content. She allows anybody
re-selling the song on her behalf to allow free streaming for the first 
10% of the song. She also wants to charge on a per download, on a sliding scale 
proportional to user-country's average yearly income per person; no downstream 
commercializing.

    <section> 
      <h3>Requirements</h3> 
 
      <ul> 
        <li>
Dynamic price calculation formulas SHOULD be allowed to be specified instead
of a fixed price.
