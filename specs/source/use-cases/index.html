The purpose of the Web Payments group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
is to create systems that enable people and businesses on the Web to send each 
other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and email today. The 
systems strive to be easy to use, currency agnostic, secure, decentralized and 
implementable by anyone in a patent and royalty-free manner. The group is 
focusing on transforming the way we reward each other on the Web as well as 
how we organize financial resources to enhance our personal lives and 
pursue endeavors that improve upon the human condition. The following use
cases outline the basic functionality that the group is attempting to
achieve.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <p>
The Web continues to transform the way humankind communicates and builds
our world. At the heart of most of these endeavors is the exchange of
value. Gifts, attention, and payments each play a role in the ecosystem
that we call the economy. Until now, there has been no open and
universal way of sending and receiving payments on the Web through your
browser. This is why people are still compelled to reach for their
credit card or log into a payment site when purchasing something over
the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
There are a number non-interoperable payment solutions today. This
document outlines use cases that are supported by existing payment
solutions today, and also outlines innovative use cases that could be
supported in the future by a universal payment mechanism to enable next
generation mobile payments, alternative currencies, crowd-sourced
investing, next-generation banking, and electronic commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification outlines use cases that are enabled by universal
payment for the Web. The goal of addressing the use cases as a whole is
to create a safe, decentralized system and a set of open, patent and
royalty-free specifications that allow people on the Web to send each
other money as easily as they exchange instant messages and e-mail
today. Addressing these scenarios will transform the way we reward each
other on the Web as well as how we organize financial resources to
enhance our personal lives and pursue endeavors that improve upon the
human condition.

    <h2>Glossary</h2>
  
    <p>
There is certain terminology used throughout this document that has a very
specific meaning. In order to state explicitly what that meaning is, the 
following definitions are provided:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>entity</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
or instance of a software program.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of information about an 
<tref title="entity">entityâ€™s</tref> background such as a name, government ID, 
<tref>payment processor</tref>, home address, or university degree.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>transaction</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a transfer of value from one <tref>entity</tref> to another.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>digital receipt</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
a proof of purchase that verifies that a particular <tref>entity</tref> was 
involved in a <tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Roles</h2>
  
    <p>
Each interaction in a Web Payments scenario involves a number of 
<tref title="entity">entities</tref>. In order to make it clear who the
actors are, the following roles are defined:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>payer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
the <tref>entity</tref> sending value in a <tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payee</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
the <tref>entity</tref> receiving value in a <tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>buyer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is performing a purchase.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>merchant</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is offering a product or service for sale.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payment processor</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
an <tref>entity</tref> that is responsible for transferring value between 
<tref title="entity">entities</tref> and 
generating verifiable <tref title="digital receipt">digital receipts</tref>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Credentials</h2>
  
    <p>
In order to interact, an <tref>entity</tref> may require one or more pieces 
of information from another entity. Each of these pieces of information, which 
may be digitally signed by a 3rd party, are called a <tref>credential</tref>. 
The following credentials are commonly used throughout this document:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>identity credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
An identity <tref>credential</tref> contains a pseudo-anonymous URL that can
be used to uniquely identify an <tref>entity</tref>. The URI typically doesn't
contain any personally identifiable information.
      </dd>

      <dt><tdef>email credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
An email <tref>credential</tref> contains a verified email address and proves 
that the <tref>entity</tref> associated with the credential has verified their
email address with a 3rd party.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payment processor credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
A <tref>payment processor</tref> <tref>credential</tref> contains a verified 
payment processor URL that was assigned to the <tref>entity</tref> associated 
with the credential by their payment processor.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>shipping address credential</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
A shipping address <tref>credential</tref> contains a verified address where
shipping deliveries may be made that is also associated with the
<tref>entity</tref> associated with the credential. Typically, organizations
that are capable of associating a shipping address with an <tref>entity</tref>,
such as the United States Postal Service, provide these credentials.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
  
    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use 
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall web payments system.
    </p>

    <section> 
      <h2>Web Intents / Protocol Handlers</h2> 
   
      <p>
Consider using Web Intents or Protocol Handlers to provide an abstraction 
layer that could be used to solve both payment initiation and other problems 
on the Web.

integrates with existing payment methods (eg: VISA, Mastercard, ACH, PayPal, 
debit card, Premium SMS, etc.)

      <h2>Authorization Configurability</h2>

Allow payment processors to define the required level of authorization for 
particular transactions based on their preferences and local regulations. 
For example: No auth for small amounts, PIN auth for medium amounts, 
Secure Element for large amounts.

information.

      <p>
A buyer discovers an offer for sale by a merchant under terms that the 
merchant is comfortable with. The offer includes a list of payment processors 
that the merchant is capable of receiving payment through. The buyer's 
software contacts a subset of those payment processors that they are capable 
of sending payment through to get finalized transaction details (such as 
price or speed) before executing the most desirable transaction.

      <h2>Choosing the Attributes of Price</h2> 
   
      <p>
Payee and payers negotiate secure price in an open market. They are free to 
choose all three essential attributes of the numeric quantity expressing a 
price (e.g. 10.99), namely: a unit-of-account (e.g. $ Â£ â‚¬ Â¥ etc.); a 
medium-of-exchange (e.g. debit card, credit card, web payment etc.); and, a 
value-in-exchange benchmark (e.g. WM Reuters Spot Exchange; Purchasing Power 
Parity; Commodity Index; etc.)
