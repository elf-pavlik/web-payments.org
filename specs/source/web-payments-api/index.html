  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or 
service by calling a <code>navigator.payment.request()</code> method. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be provided by a JavaScript
polyfill at first, and if deployment is successful, native browser 
implementations will eventually surface to enhance usability and transaction 
security.
  </p>

    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for an application programming
      interface (API) for initiating payments from within a browser
      environment. The document is primarily intended for the following
      audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        algorithms behind the API.</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement the API.</li>

<section>
  <h2>Payment Flow Overview</h2>
  <p>
A web app running on the merchant's website will interact with a 
payment service provider via 
<code>navigator.payment.register()</code>, 
<code>navigator.payment.request()</code>, and 
<code>navigator.payment.acknowledge()</code>.
Results of the payment request will be POSTed to the merchant's server.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
The Web app initiates a payment by calling 
<code>navigator.payment.request(request)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
This starts the flow by sending a payment request to the payment service
provider.
    </li>
    <li>
An interface is provided by the payment service provider.
    </li>
    <li>
The payer is authenticated by the payment service provider.
    </li>
    <li>
The payer accepts or cancels the payment request.
    </li>
    <li>
A callback is called on the merchant's page that notfies the merchants software
that the payment was successful, or canceled.
    </li>
    <li>
The merchant software receives a proof of acknowledgement by the 
payment service provider and may then verify whether or not the payment was 
processed successfully.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
The diagram below outlines the basic payment flow described above.

  <h2>Detailed Payment Flow</h2>
  <p class="issue">
Describe the payment flow in detail here using Adrian's flow diagram and Ian's
steps.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Payment Instrument Registration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payer navigates to a payment service provider website to sign up.</li>
      </li>
      <li>
During sign-up, the <code>navigator.payment.register()</code> call is made
to register a payment instrument:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a credit card registration">
var card = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentInstrument',
  scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
  label: 'ExampleBank Visa Card',
  paymentRequestService: 'https://pay.example.com/services/cards'
};

// register the payment instrument - at this point, the interface asks the 
// person for approval to store the new payment instrument
var promise = navigator.payment.register(card);

// this happens when the registration completes with success or a failure
promise.then(function(result) {
  // card has been registered, do something
}).catch(function(err) {
  // card has not been registered, do something
});
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Request</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payer navigates to a merchant's website.</li>
      <li>
The payer finds an item to payment and initiates the payment flow 
(by clicking a button, swiping, speaking a voice command, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
The merchant application generates a signed payment request, which is an 
[[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to process the
payment:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment request">
var req = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentRequest',
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
  acceptedScheme: {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
    transfer: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    destination: '20389472398',
  },
  paymentCompleteService: 'https://merchant.example.com/services/paymentComplete?transaction=923847298',
  signature: {
    type: 'GraphSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://merchant.example.com/keys/23',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:21:34Z',
    nonce: '239807882930744352',
    signatureValue: 'OGQzNGVkMzVm4NTIyZTkZ...goYzI43Q3ODIyOWM32NjI='
  }
};

// request payment and get a promise that is resolved on payment
var promise = navigator.payment.request(req);

// resolve the promise
promise.then(function(result) {
  // payment was processed by the payment processor
}).catch(function(err) {
  // payment failed to be processed by the payment processor
});
      </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Acknowledgement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payment service provider receives a payment request, authenticates the
payer, and gets approval to proceed with the payment from the payer.
      </li>
      <li>
Once approval has been provided by the payer, the payment is processed
      </li>
      <li>
The payment service processor generates a signed payment acknowledgement 
message, which is a [[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to 
verify that the transaction has completed in success or failure by the
merchant application:
        <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment acknowledgement">
var acknowledgement = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentAcknowledgement',
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets',
  selectedScheme: {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
    status: 'authorized',
    token: '10025AB',
    transfer: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    destination: '20389472398'
  },
  signature: {
    type: 'GraphSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://payment-service-provider.example.com/keys/12',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:23:15Z',
    nonce: '239807882930744352',
    signatureValue: 'm4NTIyZTOGQzNGVkMzVkZ...OWM32NjIgoYzI43Q3ODIy='
  }
};

// acknowledge that the payment was processed
navigator.payment.acknowledge(acknowledgement);
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p class="issue">
This browser-based API is provided for convenience purposes only. The 
existence of the API is absolutely not a requirement for the basic operation
of the Web Payments protocol. No browser API is necessary in order for a
Web application to initiate payment and receive an acknowledgement of the
result of the payment.
  </p>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to 
    initiate payments in a User Agent. 
    A conformant payment agent MUST implement the entirety of the 
    following API.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>NavigatorPayment</h3>

    <p>Navigator Payment is the name of the high-level programming 
      interface that Web developers use to initiate payments. If MUST be
      made available via the <code>navigator.payment</code> object.</p>

    <dl title="interface NavigatorPayment" class="idl">
      <dt>Promise register()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Typically called by a payment processor to register a payment instrument for 
later use during a payment request.
        </p>
        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object instrument</dt>
          <dd>

        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt>Promise request()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Typically called by a merchant to initiate a payment. The instrument is
encoded in [[!JSON-LD]] format.
        </p>
        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object request</dt>
          <dd>
Typically called by a merchant to request a payment. The request is
encoded in [[!JSON-LD]] format.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt>void acknowledge()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Typically called by a payment processor to acknowledge that a payment request 
has been processed. The acknowledgement is encoded in [[!JSON-LD]] format.
        </p>
        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object acknowledgement</dt>
          <dd>
A [[!JSON-LD]] encoded payment acknowledgement describing the result of a
payment request.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

  <h2>Messages Addendum</h2>

  <p>
Multiple types of payment instruments may be supported using this approach:
  </p>
  <pre class="example" title="Example of Bitcoin registration">
var bitcoin = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentInstrument',
  scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Bitcoin',
  id: 'bitcoin:19Cgacam5sVryog9QQKjFo1GApy34Qat83',
  label: 'BitExample Bitcoin Account',
  privateKeyBitcoin: '5JSjcscTvQcCb2h7LxFGwEzVqHM6HqC6xanxwZtymRZg5Z1yWot',
  paymentRequestService: 'https://bitcoin.example.com/services/bitcoin'
};

// register the payment instrument - at this point, the interface asks the 
// person for approval to store the new payment instrument
var promise = navigator.payment.register(bitcoin);

// this happens when the registration completes with success or a failure
promise.then(function(result) {
  // bitcoin instrument has been registered, do something
}).catch(function(err) {
  // bitcoin instrument has not been registered, do something
});
  </pre>

  <p>
Multiple payment requests may be collected into a single request.
