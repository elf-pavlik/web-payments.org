  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or 
service by calling a <code>navigator.payment.request()</code> method. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be provided by a JavaScript
polyfill at first, and if deployment is successful, native browser 
implementations will eventually surface to enhance usability and transaction 
security.

    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for an application programming
      interface (API) for initiating payments from within a browser
      environment. The document is primarily intended for the following
      audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        algorithms behind the API.</li>

<section>
  <h2>Payment Flow Overview</h2>
  <p>
A web app running on the merchant's website will interact with a 
payment service provider via 
<code>navigator.payment.register()</code>, 
<code>navigator.payment.request()</code>, and 
<code>navigator.payment.acknowledge()</code>.
Results of the payment request will be POSTed to the merchant's server.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
The Web app initiates a payment by calling 
<code>navigator.payments.request(request)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
This starts the flow by sending a purchase request to the payment service
provider.
    </li>
    <li>
An interface is provided by the payment service provider.
    </li>
    <li>
The payer is authenticated by the payment service provider.
    </li>
    <li>
The payer accepts or cancels the purchase request.
    </li>
    <li>
A callback is called on the merchant's page that notfies the merchants software
that the purchase was successful, or canceled.
    </li>
    <li>
The merchant software receives a proof of acknowledgement by the 
payment service provider and may then verify whether or not the payment was 
processed successfully.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
The diagram below outlines the basic payment flow described above.

  <h2>Detailed Payment Flow</h2>
  <p class="issue">
Describe the payment flow in detail here using Adrian's flow diagram and Ian's
steps.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Payment Instrument Registration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payer navigates to a payment service provider website to sign up.</li>
      </li>
      <li>
During sign-up, the <code>navigator.payment.register()</code> call is made
to register a payment instrument:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a credit card registration">
var card = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
  label: 'ExampleBank Visa Card'
  paymentRequestService: 'https://pay.example.com/services/cards',
}

// register the payment instrument - at this point, the interface asks the 
// person for approval to store the new payment instrument
navigator.payment.register(card, function(success) {
  if(success) {
    // card has been registered
  } else {
    // card has not been registered
  }
});
        </pre>
Multiple types of payment instruments may be supported using this approach:
        <pre class="example" title="Example of Bitcoin registration">
var bitcoin = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Bitcoin',
  label: 'BitExample Bitcoin Account'
  paymentRequestService: 'https://pay.example.com/services/bitcoin',
}
navigator.payment.register(bitcoin, function(success) {
  if(success) {
    // instrument has been registered
  } else {
    // instrument has not been registered
  }
});
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Request</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payer navigates to a merchant's website.</li>
      <li>
The payer finds an item to purchase and initiates the payment flow 
(by clicking a button, swiping, speaking a voice command, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
The merchant application generates a signed purchase request, which is an 
[[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to process the
payment:
      <pre class="example" title="Example of a purchase request">
var req = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentRequest'
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets'
  acceptedScheme: {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa'
    monetaryRequest: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    destination: '20389472398'
  },
  paymentCompleteService: 'https://merchant.example.com/services/paymentComplete?transaction=923847298'
  signature: {
    type: 'GraphSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://merchant.example.com/keys/23',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:21:34Z',
    signatureValue: 'OGQzNGVkMzVm4NTIyZTkZ...goYzI43Q3ODIyOWM32NjI='
  }
}

// request payment and get a promise that is resolved on payment
var acknowledgement = navigator.payment.request([req]);

// resolve the promise
acknowledgement.then(function(acknowledgement) {
  if(acknowledgement.status === 'processed') {
    // payment was processed by the payment processor
  } else {
    // payment was not processed by the payment processor
  }
});
      </pre>

A more involved example can be found here:

      <pre class="example" title="Example of a complex purchase request">
var reqOne = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentRequest'
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for Widget 1'
  acceptedScheme: [{
    scheme: [
      'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa',
      'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Mastercard',
      'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Discover'
    ],
    monetaryRequest: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    destination: '20389472398'
  }, {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Bitcoin',
    monetaryRequest: {
      amount: '0.0177',
      currency: 'BTC'
    },
    destination: '3QJmV3qfvL9SuYo34YihAf3sRCW3qSinyC'
  }
  paymentCompleteService: 'https://merchant.example.com/services/paymentComplete?transaction=923847298'
  signature: {
    type: 'GraphSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://merchant.example.com/keys/23',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:21:34Z',
    signatureValue: 'OGQzNGVkMzVm4NTIyZTkZ...goYzI43Q3ODIyOWM32NjI='
  }
}

// second request (reqTwo) is generated here, omitted for readability

// request payment and get a promise that is resolved on payment acknowledgement
var acknowledgement = navigator.payment.request([reqOne, reqTwo]);

// resolve the promise (performed in the next section)
acknowledgement.then(function(acknowledgement) {
  if(acknowledgement.status === 'processed') {
    // payment was processed by the payment processor
  } else {
    // payment was not processed by the payment processor
  }
});
      </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing a Payment Acknowledgement</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The payment service provider receives a payment request, authenticates the
payer, and gets approval to proceed with the payment from the payer.
      </li>
      <li>
Once approval has been provided by the payer, the payment is processed
      </li>
      <li>
The payment service processor generates a signed payment acknowledgement 
message, which is a [[!JSON-LD]] object that contains enough information to 
verify that the transaction has completed in success or failure by the
merchant application:
        <pre class="example" title="Example of a payment acknowledgement">
var acknowledgement = {
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/web-payments/v1',
  type: 'PaymentAcknowledgement'
  description: 'Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets"
  status: 'processed',
  scheme: {
    scheme: 'https://w3id.org/payment-schemes#Visa'
    monetaryRequest: {
      amount: '4.35',
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    destination: '20389472398'
  },
  signature: {
    type: 'GraphSignature2015',
    creator: 'https://payment-service-provider.example.com/keys/12',
    created: '2015-09-23T20:23:15Z',
    signatureValue: 'm4NTIyZTOGQzNGVkMzVkZ...OWM32NjIgoYzI43Q3ODIy='
 }
}

// acknowledge that the payment was processed
navigator.payment.acknowledge(acknowledgement);
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p class="issue">
This browser-based API is provided for convenience purposes only. The 
existence of the API is absolutely not a requirement for the basic operation
of the Web Payments protocol. No browser API is necessary in order for a
Web application to initiate payment and receive an acknowledgement of the
result of the payment.
  </p>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to 
    initiate payments in a User Agent. 
    A conformant payment agent MUST implement the entirety of the 
    following API.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>NavigatorPayment</h3>

    <p>Navigator Payment is the name of the high-level programming 
      interface that Web developers use to initiate payments. If MUST be
      made available via the <code>navigator.payment</code> object.</p>

    <dl title="interface NavigatorPayment" class="idl">
      <dt>DOMRequest request()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Initiates a payment given an array of [[!JSON-LD]] encoded payment 
requests describing the type of financial operations to perform.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
Should we break refunds out into their own method call? The downside of doing
that is that the API is no longer fairly generic. However, .request() doesn't
really imply "refund", unless you think of a refund like a reverse payment?
The other thing we could do is use .process() or .transact() as the method
call and change the interface name to something like 
navigator.funds.transact() or navigator.wallet.transact().
        </p>
        <p>
Each request object will contain a <code>typ</code> key. The value associated
with this key will be used to perform matchmaking between the customer's list 
of registered payment providers and the list of preferred payment providers 
for the Merchant. Typically, a User Agent will 
request that the customer rank their registered payment providers in most 
preferable to least preferable order. If this ranking is performed, 
a payment provider can be selected automatically by picking highest ranked
payment provider in the customer's payment provider list with a payment 
provider that also exists in the Merchant's payment provider list. 
        </p>
        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object[] requests</dt>
          <dd>An array of [[!JSON-LD]] encoded payment requests describing 
          the type of financial operations to perform.</dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
