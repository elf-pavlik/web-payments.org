    <h1 id="title">PaySwarm Working Group Charter</h1>

    <p>The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">PaySwarm Working
    Group</a> <span class="atat">@@@Link to be provided@@@</span> is to
    standardize mechanisms for the legal transfer of commercialized digital
    content. The group plans to enable new Web-based business models by
    specifying methods of interaction between user agents and web servers to
    exchange digital goods and ensure the subequent distribution of monetary
    compensation to the content distributors and rights holders.</p>

    <p>The Working Group will publish W3C Recommendations to enable the
    execution of the <a href="payswarm-use-cases.html">PaySwarm Use Cases</a>
    in user agents and web servers. The group will also document discoveries
    and future features.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>Electronic commerce sales for the 2008 fiscal year in the USA was
      roughly $204 billion dollars. The vast majority of these sales were
      performed using non-interoperable shopping cart software, credit card
      processing software and many layers of unnecessary, proprietary
      protocols for exchanging information related to payments and
      transaction processing that simultaneously ignore the fundamental
      architecture of the Web.</p>

      <p>The rise of the sale of digital goods online and the lack of a
      standard protocol for listing and selling digital goods further
      demonstrates a standards need that is not currently being met. The Web
      has changed the way distribution of digitizable goods occurs. For
      example, instead of receiving photographs from a photographer, photo
      proofs are often now uploaded to a website. Physical prints are often
      secondary and are purchased through a variety of photo printing
      services. Music, books and video are among the media that are
      transitioning to a variety of digital distribution models. The common
      thread among the sale of all of these digital goods is the transaction
      mechanism that is currently used, or rather, the lack of a web standard
      for transacting digital goods online. Ideally, our web browsers could
      handle the acquisition of digital goods just as they handle the
      acquisition of digital files from remote websites.</p>

      <p>This unmet need has resulted in a variety of negative market
      effects, most notably with regard to the distribution of digital music.
      The wide-spread failure of Digital Rights Management and the inability
      for user agents to provide legal downloads as a first class citizen
      have created an environment that places corporation and customer
      against one another when they could be working together to legally
      distribute digital content.</p>

      <p>Digital content piracy has been a significant disruption to the
      operation of the Web for over a decade. While this is partially due to
      a number of factors that are outside of the control of standards
      bodies, there remains one key oversight that the standards
      organizations could address that would enable new business models via
      the Web while reducing the incentive to illegally disseminate digital
      files. If Alice has a MP3 song that she would like to give Bob, there
      should be a simple mechanism to enable the legal duplication of that
      copyrighted work from Alice to Bob. There should be a standard
      mechanism for the legal exchange of commercially viable digital
      content.</p>

      <p>At present, digital media sales on the Web is largely a producer to
      consumer model. Typically, sites like Apple iTunes, Amazon Music,
      Netflix, the Microsoft Zune store and other digital retailers create
      proprietary, Web-based store fronts to sell digital products to their
      customers. During the product sale, the item is either wrapped in
      Digital Rights Management technologies in an attempt to curb piracy or
      restrictively licensed only to the individual purchasing the digital
      good. This is strictly a corporation-to-consumer experience.</p>

      <p>There currently is no secondary market for digital content sales due
      to the nature of digital media - reproducing a digital file is
      incredibly fast, cheap and easy. This fact has lead to a great amount
      of digital piracy, notably by peer-to-peer network technology such as
      Napster, BearShare, Morpheus, Gnutella, Kazaa and BitTorrent. While
      iTunes has claimed to make as many as 435,164 video sales per day
      through their store, the number of video downloads per day over
      Mininova, one of the largest BitTorrent networks (2008), approach close
      to 4,975,075 downloads per day. Close to ten times as much video
      traffic is served through a single BitTorrent community versus the
      number two digital video sales service in the world.</p>

      <p>While it is still fairly unknown how much DRM, industry tactics,
      value proposition, platform access, file formats, convenience and
      digital kleptomania contribute to piracy - it can be said that each is
      a contributor to piracy in todays digital media ecosystem. By
      addressing some of the use cases outlined in this document, we may be
      able to address the following key areas that are currently overlooked
      by the major players: value proposition, platform access, file formats,
      and convenience. The end-goal is to create a standards-based
      peer-to-peer network, driven by open, flexible standards, that allow
      customers to help artists, production companies and creators of content
      to distribute digital goods in exchange for financial compensation.
      Just as physical storefronts help to distribute products on behalf of
      their manufacturers, digital storefonts can help to distribute content
      on behalf of their creators.</p>

      <p>Providing a standard mechanism for web browsers to exchange digital
      goods in exchange for monetary compensation would provide a much needed
      core feature of the Web that has been a demonstrated need for over a
      decade.</p>
