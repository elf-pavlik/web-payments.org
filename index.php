          <p>We are making it easier to send and receive money over the Web. For over two decades, email has enabled us to communicate with our friends, loved ones, and colleagues the world over. The reason email works so well is because a group of people 
got together many years ago and created a standard way for email to travel across the Internet. To date, we have never sat down and done the
same thing for money. There is no global standard for sending money over the Internet, and we think that there should be one.</p>

          <p>A large group of us are doing just this at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webpayments/">Web Payments Community Group</a>. We are making it as easy and fast to send money around the world as it is to send an email. We are build and documenting technology that explains exactly how money moves around the world via the Web. Our approach is different from the way traditional payment technology is built. We believe in a level playing field. We operate out in the open. We are transparent. Come <a href="join">join us</a> and make a difference in the world.</p>

           <p>The Web Payments Community Group operates under the framework of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, the group that creates the core technology for the Web. It also participates heavily in work at the <a href="http://ietf.org">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>. While neither the W3C or IETF officially endorses any work performed by a community group, the
purpose of this community group is to create documents that will most likely be promoted for standardization by standards setting organizations.
The primary output of the Web Payments Community Group are technology documents that may be elevated to world standards through
standardization bodies like the W3C and IETF, and then implemented by technology companies, merchants, payment processors, banks, and government. A summary of the 
technologies we are working on can be found below, further details can be found on the <a href="specs/">specifications page</a>.
